<tr><td class="vn">1:22</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Then Ahiqar interceded on my behalf, and I returned to Nineveh. Ahiqar had been chief cupbearer, keeper of the signet ring, treasury accountant, and credit accountant under Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians; and Esarhaddon appointed him as Second to himself. He was, in fact, my nephew, of my father's house, and of my own family.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:1</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Thus under King Esarhaddon I returned to my home, and my wife Anna and my son Tobiah were restored to me.

<tr><td class="vn">2:2</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">The table was set for me, and the dishes placed before me were many. So I said to my son Tobiah: &quot;Son, go out and bring in whatever poor person you find among our kindred exiled here in Nineveh who may be a sincere worshiper of God to share this meal with me. Indeed, son, I shall wait for you to come back.&quot;</td></tr>

He has been thrown out into the market place, and there he lies strangled.&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:4</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">I sprang to my feet, leaving the dinner untouched, carried the dead man from the square, and put him in one of the rooms until sundown, so that I might bury him.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="vn">2:6</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">I remembered the oracle pronounced by the prophet Amos against Bethel: &quot;I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into dirges.&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:7</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Then I wept. At sunset I went out, dug a grave, and buried him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:8</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">My neighbors mocked me, saying: &quot;Does he have no fear? Once before he was hunted, to be executed for this sort of deed, and he ran away; yet here he is again burying the dead!&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:9</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">That same night I washed and went into my courtyard, where I lay down to sleep beside the wall. Because of the heat I left my face uncovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:10</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">I did not know that sparrows were perched on the wall above me; their warm droppings settled in my eyes, causing white scales on them. I went to doctors for a cure, but the more they applied ointments, the more my vision was obscured by the white scales, until I was totally blind. For four years I was unable to see, and all my kindred were distressed at my condition. Ahiqar, however, took care of me for two years, until he left for Elam.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:11</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">At that time my wife Anna worked for hire at weaving cloth, doing the kind of work women do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:12</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">When she delivered the material to her employers, they would pay her a wage. On the seventh day of the month of Dystrus, she finished the woven cloth and delivered it to her employers. They paid her the full salary and also gave her a young goat for a meal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:13</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">On entering my house, the goat began to bleat. So I called to my wife and said: &quot;Where did this goat come from? It was not stolen, was it? Give it back to its owners; we have no right to eat anything stolen!&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">2:14</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">But she said to me, &quot;It was given to me as a bonus over and above my wages.&quot; Yet I would not believe her and told her to give it back to its owners. I flushed with anger at her over this. So she retorted: &quot;Where are your charitable deeds now? Where are your righteous acts? Look! All that has happened to you is well known!&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:1</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Then sad at heart, I groaned and wept aloud. With sobs I began to pray:</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:2</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">You are righteous, Lord, and all your deeds are just; All your ways are mercy and fidelity; you are judge of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:3</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">And now, Lord, be mindful of me and look with favor upon me. Do not punish me for my sins, or for my inadvertent offenses, or for those of my ancestors.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:4</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">They sinned against you, and disobeyed your commandments. So you handed us over to plunder, captivity, and death, to become an object lesson, a byword, and a reproach in all the nations among whom you scattered us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:5</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Yes, your many judgments are right in dealing with me as my sins, and those of my ancestors, deserve. For we have neither kept your commandments, nor walked in fidelity before you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:6</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">So now, deal with me as you please; command my life breath to be taken from me, that I may depart from the face of the earth and become dust. It is better for me to die than to live, because I have listened to undeserved reproaches, and great is the grief within me. Lord, command that I be released from such anguish; let me go to my everlasting abode; Do not turn your face away from me, Lord. For it is better for me to die than to endure so much misery in life, and to listen to such reproaches!</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:7</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">On that very day, at Ecbatana in Media, it so happened that Raguel's daughter Sarah also had to listen to reproaches from one of her father's maids.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:8</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">For she had been given in marriage to seven husbands, but the wicked demon Asmodeus kept killing them off before they could have intercourse with her, as is prescribed for wives. The maid said to her: &quot;You are the one who kills your husbands! Look! You have already been given in marriage to seven husbands, but you do not bear the name of a single one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:9</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Why do you beat us? If they are dead, go join them! May we never see son or daughter of yours!&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:10</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">That day Sarah was sad at heart. She went in tears to an upper chamber in her father's house with the intention of hanging herself. But she reconsidered, saying to herself: &quot;No! May people never reproach my father and say to him, 'You had only one beloved daughter, but she hanged herself because of her misfortune!' And thus I would bring my father's old age down to Hades with grief. It is better for me not to hang myself, but to beg the Lord that I might die, so that I need no longer listen to such reproaches.&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:11</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">At that time, with hands outstretched toward the window, she implored favor:</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:12</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">&quot;Blessed are you, Lord, merciful God! Blessed be your holy and honorable name forever! May all your works praise you forever!</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:13</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">And now, Lord, I have turned my face and my eyes toward you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:14</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Bid me to depart from the earth, that I may no longer hear such reproaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:15</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">You know, Master, that I am clean of any sin with a man, and that I have never defiled my name or my father's name in the land of my captivity. I am my father's only daughter, and he has no other child to be his heir, nor does he have a kinsman or close relative whose wife I should wait to become. Seven husbands of mine have already died. Why should I live any longer? But if it does not please you, Lord, that I should die, look favorably upon me and have pity on me, that I may never again listen to such reproaches!&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:16</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">At that very time, the prayer of both of them was heard in the glorious presence of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">3:17</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">So Raphael was sent to heal them both: to remove the white scales from Tobit's eyes, so that he might again see with his own eyes God's light; and to give Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, as a wife to Tobiah, the son of Tobit, and to rid her of the wicked demon Asmodeus. For it fell to Tobiah's lot to claim her before any others who might wish to marry her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:1</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">That same day Tobit remembered the money he had deposited in trust with Gabael at Rages in Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:2</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">He thought to himself, &quot;Now that I have asked for death, why should I not call my son Tobiah and let him know about this money before I die?&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:3</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">So he called his son Tobiah; and when he came, he said to him: &quot;Son, when I die, give me a decent burial. Honor your mother, and do not abandon her as long as she lives. Do whatever pleases her, and do not grieve her spirit in any way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:4</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Remember, son, how she went through many dangers for you while you were in her womb. When she dies, bury her in the same grave with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:5</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Through all your days, son, keep the Lord in mind, and do not seek to sin or to transgress the commandments. Perform righteous deeds all the days of your life, and do not tread the paths of wickedness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:6</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">For those who act with fidelity, all who practice righteousness, will prosper in their affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:7</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Give alms from your possessions. Do not turn your face away from any of the poor, so that God's face will not be turned away from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:8</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Give in proportion to what you own. If you have great wealth, give alms out of your abundance; if you have but little, do not be afraid to give alms even of that little.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:9</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">You will be storing up a goodly treasure for yourself against the day of necessity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:10</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">For almsgiving delivers from death, and keeps one from entering into Darkness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:11</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Almsgiving is a worthy offering in the sight of the Most High for all who practice it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:12</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Be on your guard, son, against every kind of fornication, and above all, marry a woman of your own ancestral family. Do not marry a foreign woman, one who is not of your father's tribe, because we are descendants of the prophets. My son, remember that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our ancestors from the beginning, all took wives from among their own kindred and were blessed in their children. Remember that their posterity shall inherit the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:13</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Therefore, son, love your kindred. Do not act arrogantly toward any of your kindred, the sons and daughters of your people, by refusing to take a wife for yourself from among them. For in such arrogance there is ruin and much trouble, and in idleness there is loss and dire poverty, because idleness is the mother of famine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:14</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Do not keep with you overnight the wages of anyone who works for you, but pay them at once. If you serve God, you will receive your reward. Be on your guard, son, in everything you do, and discipline yourself in all your conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:15</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Do to no one what you yourself hate. Do not drink wine to excess or let drunkenness accompany you on your way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:16</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Give to the hungry some of your food, and to the naked some of your clothing. Whatever you have left over, give away as alms; and do not let your eye begrudge the gift when you make it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:17</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Be generous with bread and wine at the burial of the righteous, but do not eat or drink with sinners.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:18</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Seek counsel from every wise person, and do not think lightly of any useful advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:19</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">At all times bless the Lord your God, and ask him to guide your paths and to grant success to all your endeavors and plans. For no nation possesses good counsel, but the Lord gives all good things. Whomever the Lord chooses to humble is cast down to the depths of Hades. So now, son, keep in mind these commandments; do not let them be erased from your heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:20</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">And now, son, I am going to tell you about the ten talents of silver I deposited in trust with Gabael, son of Gabri, at Rages in Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">4:21</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Do not fear, son, that we have become poor. You will be a rich man if you fear God, avoid all sin, and do what is good before the Lord your God.&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vn">5:1</td><td class="vn">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="v en">Then Tobiah replied to his father Tobit: &quot;Everything that you have commanded me, father, I shall do.</td></tr>
