Genesis 1:1 1 Genesis 1:28
The First Book ofMoses,
Commonly Called
Genesis
1Inthe beginning, God †created the
heavens andtheearth.
2The earth was formless and empty.
Darkness was onthesurface ofthedeep
and God ’sSpirit was hovering over the
surface ofthewaters.
3God said, “Letthere belight, ”andthere
waslight.
4God saw thelight, and saw that itwas
good. God divided thelight from thedark-
ness.
5Godcalled thelight “day ”,andthedark-
ness hecalled “night ”.There was evening
andthere wasmorning, thefirst day.
6God said, “Letthere beanexpanse in
themiddle ofthewaters, and letitdivide
thewaters from thewaters. ”
7God made theexpanse, and divided
thewaters which were under theexpanse
from thewaters which were above the
expanse; anditwasso.
8God called theexpanse “sky”.There
was evening and there was morning, a
second day.
9God said, “Letthewaters under thesky
begathered together tooneplace, and let
thedryland appear; ”anditwasso.
10God called thedryland “earth ”,and
thegathering together ofthewaters he
called “seas ”.God sawthat itwasgood.
11God said, “Lettheearth yield grass,
herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bear-
ingfruit after their kind, with their seeds
init,ontheearth; ”anditwasso.
12Theearth yielded grass, herbs yielding
seed after their kind, and trees bearing
fruit, with their seeds init,after their kind;
andGod sawthat itwasgood.
13There was evening and there was
morning, athird day.
14God said, “Letthere belights inthe
expanse oftheskytodivide thedayfrom
thenight; andletthem beforsigns tomark
seasons, days, andyears;15and letthem beforlights intheex-
panse oftheskytogive light ontheearth; ”
anditwasso.
16God made thetwo great lights: the
greater light torule theday, andthelesser
light torule thenight. Healso made the
stars.
17God setthem intheexpanse ofthesky
togive light totheearth,
18and torule over theday and over
thenight, and todivide thelight from the
darkness. God sawthat itwasgood.
19There was evening and there was
morning, afourth day.
20God said, “Letthewaters abound with
living creatures, andletbirds flyabove the
earth intheopen expanse ofthesky. ”
21God created thelarge seacreatures
andevery living creature that moves, with
which thewaters swarmed, after their
kind, andevery winged bird after itskind.
God sawthat itwasgood.
22God blessed them, saying, “Befruitful,
and multiply, and fillthewaters inthe
seas, andletbirds multiply ontheearth. ”
23There was evening and there was
morning, afifth day.
24Godsaid, “Lettheearth produce living
creatures after their kind, livestock, creep-
ingthings, and animals oftheearth after
their kind; ”anditwasso.
25God made theanimals oftheearth
after their kind, and thelivestock after
their kind, and everything that creeps on
theground after itskind. God saw that it
wasgood.
26God said, “Let’smake man inourim-
age, after our likeness. Letthem have
dominion over thefishofthesea,andover
thebirds ofthesky,andover thelivestock,
and over alltheearth, and over every
creeping thing that creeps ontheearth. ”
27God created man inhisown image.
InGod ’simage hecreated him; male and
female hecreated them.
28God blessed them. God said tothem,
“Befruitful, multiply, filltheearth, and
subdue it.Have dominion over thefish
ofthesea, over thebirds ofthesky, and
†1:1TheHebrew word rendered “God ”is“אֱֹלהִ֑ים ”(Elohim).

Genesis 1:29 2 Genesis 2:23
over every living thing that moves onthe
earth. ”
29God said, “Behold, ‡Ihave given you
every herb yielding seed, which isonthe
surface ofalltheearth, and every tree,
which bears fruit yielding seed. Itwillbe
your food.
30Toevery animal oftheearth, and to
every bird ofthesky, and toeverything
that creeps ontheearth, inwhich there
islife, Ihave given every green herb for
food; ”anditwasso.
31Godsaweverything thathehadmade,
and, behold, itwas very good. There was
evening and there was morning, asixth
day.
2
1The heavens, theearth, and alltheir
vast array were finished.
2Ontheseventh day God finished his
work which hehaddone; andherested on
theseventh dayfrom allhiswork which he
haddone.
3God blessed theseventh day,andmade
itholy, because herested initfrom allhis
work ofcreation which hehaddone.
4This isthehistory ofthegenerations
oftheheavens andoftheearth when they
were created, intheday that theLORD †
God made theearth andtheheavens.
5Noplant ofthefield was yetinthe
earth, and noherb ofthefield had yet
sprung up; fortheLORD God had not
caused ittorain ontheearth. There was
notaman totilltheground,
6butamist went upfrom theearth, and
watered thewhole surface oftheground.
7The LORD God formed man from the
dust oftheground, and breathed into his
nostrils thebreath oflife;andman became
aliving soul.
8The LORD God planted agarden east-
ward, inEden, and there heputtheman
whom hehadformed.
9Outoftheground theLORD God made
every tree togrow that ispleasant tothe
sight, andgood forfood, including thetreeoflifeinthemiddle ofthegarden andthe
tree oftheknowledge ofgood andevil.
10Ariver went outofEden towater the
garden; andfrom there itwas parted, and
became thesource offour rivers.
11Thename ofthefirst isPishon: itflows
through thewhole land ofHavilah, where
there isgold;
12andthegold ofthat land isgood. Bdel-
lium ‡andonyx stone arealso there.
13Thename ofthesecond river isGihon.
Itisthesame river that flows through the
whole land ofCush.
14The name ofthethird river isHid-
dekel. This istheonewhich flows infront
ofAssyria. The fourth river istheEu-
phrates.
15TheLORD God took theman, and put
him into thegarden ofEden tocultivate
andkeep it.
16TheLORD God commanded theman,
saying, “Youmay freely eatofevery treeof
thegarden;
17butyoushall noteatofthetree ofthe
knowledge ofgood andevil; forintheday
that youeatofit,youwillsurely die. ”
18TheLORD God said, “Itisnotgood for
theman tobealone. Iwill make him a
helper comparable to§him. ”
19Out ofthe ground the LORD God
formed every animal ofthefield, and ev-
erybird ofthesky,andbrought them tothe
man toseewhat hewould callthem. What-
ever theman called every living creature
became itsname.
20The man gave names toalllivestock,
and tothebirds ofthesky, and toevery
animal ofthefield; butforman there was
notfound ahelper comparable tohim.
21TheLORD God caused theman tofall
intoadeep sleep. Astheman slept, hetook
oneofhisribs, andclosed uptheflesh inits
place.
22The LORD God made awoman from
theribwhich hehadtaken from theman,
andbrought hertotheman.
23Theman said, “This isnow bone ofmy
bones, and flesh ofmyflesh. Shewill be

called ‘woman, ’because shewastaken out
ofMan. ”
24Therefore aman willleave hisfather
andhismother, andwilljoinwith hiswife,
andthey willbeoneflesh.
25The man and hiswife were both
naked, andthey were notashamed.

1Now theserpent was more subtle than
any animal ofthefield which theLORD
Godhadmade. Hesaid tothewoman, “Has
God really said, ‘You shall noteatofany
tree ofthegarden ’?”
2The woman said totheserpent, “We
may eatfruit from thetrees ofthegarden,
3butnotthefruit ofthetree which isin
themiddle ofthegarden. God hassaid,
‘Youshall noteatofit.Youshall nottouch
it,lestyoudie. ’ ”
4The serpent said tothewoman, “You
won ’treally die,
5forGod knows that inthedayyoueat
it,your eyes will beopened, and youwill
belikeGod, knowing good andevil. ”
6When thewoman sawthatthetreewas
good forfood, and that itwas adelight
totheeyes, and that thetree was tobe
desired tomake onewise, shetook some of
itsfruit, andate.Then shegave some toher
husband with her,andheateit,too.
7Their eyes were opened, andthey both
knew that they were naked. They sewed
figleaves together, andmade coverings for
themselves.
8They heard theLORD God ’svoice walk-
inginthegarden inthecool oftheday,and
theman andhiswife hidthemselves from
thepresence oftheLORD God among the
trees ofthegarden.
9The LORD God called totheman, and
said tohim, “Where areyou? ”
10The man said, “Iheard your voice in
thegarden, andIwasafraid, because Iwas
naked; soIhidmyself. ”
11God said, “Who toldyouthat youwere
naked? Have youeaten from thetree that
Icommanded younottoeatfrom? ”
12Theman said, “Thewoman whom you
gave tobewith me,shegave mefruit from
thetree, andIateit.”13The LORD God said tothewoman,
“What have youdone? ”
Thewoman said, “Theserpent deceived
me,andIate. ”
14TheLORD God said totheserpent,
“Because youhave done this,
youarecursed above alllivestock,
andabove every animal ofthefield.
Youshall goonyour belly
and you shall eatdust allthedays of
your life.
15Iwillputhostility between youand the
woman,
and between your offspring and her
offspring.
Hewillbruise your head,
andyouwillbruise hisheel. ”
16Tothewoman hesaid,
“Iwillgreatly multiply your pain inchild-
birth.
Youwillbear children inpain.
Your desire willbeforyour husband,
andhewillrule over you. ”
17ToAdam hesaid,
“Because youhave listened toyour wife ’s
voice,
andhave eaten from thetree,
about which Icommanded you, say-
ing, ‘Youshall noteatofit,’
theground iscursed foryour sake.
Youwilleatfrom itwith much labor allthe
days ofyour life.
18Itwill yield thorns and thistles to
you;
andyouwilleattheherb ofthefield.
19Youwilleatbread bythesweat ofyour
face until youreturn totheground,
foryouwere taken outofit.
Foryouaredust,
andyoushall return todust. ”
20The man called hiswife Evebecause
shewould bethemother ofalltheliving.
21TheLORD God made garments ofan-
imal skins forAdam and forhiswife, and
clothed them.
22TheLORD God said, “Behold, theman
hasbecome likeoneofus,knowing good
and evil. Now, lesthereach outhishand,
andalsotake ofthetreeoflife,andeat,and
liveforever —”

Genesis 3:23 4 Genesis 4:25
23Therefore theLORD God sent him out
from thegarden ofEden, totilltheground
from which hewastaken.
24Sohedrove outtheman; andheplaced
cherubim †attheeast ofthegarden of
Eden, and aflaming sword which turned

1Theman knew †Evehiswife. Shecon-
ceived, ‡andgave birth toCain, andsaid, “I
have gotten aman with theLORD ’shelp. ”
2Again shegave birth, toCain ’sbrother
Abel. Abel was akeeper ofsheep, butCain
wasatiller oftheground.
3Astime passed, Cain brought anof-
fering totheLORD from thefruit ofthe
ground.
4Abel also brought some ofthefirstborn
ofhisflock and ofitsfat. The LORD re-
spected Abel andhisoffering,
5buthedidn ’trespect Cain andhisoffer-
ing. Cain was very angry, and theexpres-
sion onhisface fell.
6The LORD said toCain, “Why areyou
angry? Why hastheexpression ofyour
face fallen?
7Ifyoudowell, won ’titbelifted up? If
youdon ’tdowell, sincrouches atthedoor.
Itsdesire isforyou, butyouaretorule over
it.”
8Cain said toAbel, hisbrother, “Let’sgo
intothefield. ”While they were inthefield,
Cain rose upagainst Abel, hisbrother, and
killed him.
9TheLORD said toCain, “Where isAbel,
your brother? ”
Hesaid, “Idon ’tknow. AmImybrother ’s
keeper? ”
10TheLORD said, “What have youdone?
Thevoice ofyour brother ’sblood cries to
mefrom theground.
11Now you arecursed because ofthe
ground, which has opened itsmouth to
receive your brother ’sblood from your
hand.
12From now on, when you tillthe
ground, itwon ’tyield itsstrength toyou.Youwillbeafugitive andawanderer inthe
earth. ”
13Cain said totheLORD, “Mypunish-
ment isgreater than Icanbear.
14Behold, youhave driven meouttoday
from thesurface oftheground. Iwill be
hidden from your face, andIwillbeafugi-
tiveandawanderer intheearth. Whoever
finds mewillkillme. ”
15The LORD said tohim, “Therefore
whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be
taken onhim sevenfold. ”The LORD ap-
pointed asign forCain, sothat anyone
finding him would notstrike him.
16Cain lefttheLORD ’spresence, and
lived intheland ofNod, east ofEden.
17Cain knew hiswife. She conceived,
and gave birth toEnoch. Hebuilt acity,
and named thecityafter thename ofhis
son, Enoch.
18Irad was born toEnoch. Irad became
thefather ofMehujael. Mehujael became
thefather ofMethushael. Methushael be-
came thefather ofLamech.
19Lamech took twowives: thename of
thefirst onewasAdah, andthename ofthe
second onewasZillah.
20Adah gave birth toJabal, who was the
father ofthose who dwell intents andhave
livestock.
21Hisbrother ’sname was Jubal, who
was thefather ofallwho handle theharp
andpipe.
22Zillah also gave birth toTubal Cain,
theforger ofevery cutting instrument of
bronze and iron. Tubal Cain ’ssister was
Naamah.
23Lamech said tohiswives,
“Adah andZillah, hear myvoice.
You wives ofLamech, listen tomy
speech,
forIhave slain aman forwounding me,
ayoung man forbruising me.
24IfCain willbeavenged seven times,
truly Lamech seventy-seven times. ”
25Adam knew hiswife again. Shegave
birth toason, and named him Seth, say-
ing, “forGod hasgiven meanother child
instead ofAbel, forCain killed him. ”

Genesis 6:2 6 Genesis 7:6
2God ’ssons saw that men ’sdaughters
were beautiful, andthey took anythatthey
wanted forthemselves aswives.
3The LORD said, “MySpirit will not
strive with man forever, because healso
isflesh; sohisdays will beone hundred
twenty years. ”
4The Nephilim †were intheearth in
those days, and also after that, when
God ’ssons came intomen ’sdaughters
and had children with them. Those were
themighty men who were ofold, men of
renown.
5The LORD saw that thewickedness of
man wasgreat intheearth, andthat every
imagination ofthethoughts ofman ’sheart
wascontinually only evil.
6TheLORD was sorry that hehadmade
man ontheearth, anditgrieved him inhis
heart.
7The LORD said, “Iwill destroy man
whom Ihave created from thesurface
oftheground —man, along with animals,
creeping things, and birds ofthesky—for
Iamsorry that Ihave made them. ”
8ButNoah found favor intheLORD ’s
eyes.
9This isthehistory ofthegenerations of
Noah: Noah was arighteous man, blame-
less among thepeople ofhistime. Noah
walked with God.
10Noah became thefather ofthree sons:
Shem, Ham, andJapheth.
11Theearth wascorrupt before God, and
theearth wasfilled with violence.
12God sawtheearth, andsawthat itwas
corrupt, forallflesh had corrupted their
way ontheearth.
13God said toNoah, “Iwillbring anend
toallflesh, fortheearth isfilled with vio-
lence through them. Behold, Iwilldestroy
them andtheearth.
14Make aship ofgopher wood. Youshall
make rooms intheship, and shall seal it
inside andoutside with pitch.
15This ishow you shall make it.The
length oftheship shall bethree hundred
cubits, ‡itswidth fifty cubits, anditsheight
thirty cubits.16Youshall make aroof intheship, and
youshall finish ittoacubit upward. You
shall setthedoor oftheship initsside. You
shall make itwith lower, second, andthird
levels.
17I,even I,willbring theflood ofwaters
onthisearth, todestroy allflesh having the
breath oflifefrom under thesky. Every-
thing that isintheearth willdie.
18ButIwillestablish mycovenant with
you. You shall come into theship, you,
your sons, your wife, andyour sons ’wives
with you.
19Ofevery living thing ofallflesh, you
shall bring twoofevery sort into theship,
tokeep them alive with you. They shall be
male andfemale.
20Ofthebirds after their kind, ofthelive-
stock after their kind, ofevery creeping
thing oftheground after itskind, two of
every sort will come toyou, tokeep them
alive.
21Take with yousome ofallfood that is
eaten, andgather ittoyourself; anditwill
beforfood foryou, andforthem. ”
22Thus Noah did. Hedidallthat God
commanded him.

1TheLORD said toNoah, “Come with all
ofyour household into theship, forIhave
seen your righteousness before meinthis
generation.
2You shall take seven pairs ofevery
clean animal with you, themale and his
female. Oftheanimals that arenotclean,
take two, themale andhisfemale.

4Inseven days, Iwillcause ittorain on

him; then theLORD shut him in.
17Theflood was forty days ontheearth.
The waters increased, and lifted upthe
ship, anditwaslifted upabove theearth.
18Thewaters rose, andincreased greatly
ontheearth; and theship floated onthe
surface ofthewaters.
19Thewaters rose very high ontheearth.
Allthehigh mountains thatwere under the
whole skywere covered.
20Thewaters rose fifteen cubits †higher,
andthemountains were covered.
21Allflesh died that moved ontheearth,
including birds, livestock, animals, every
creeping thing that creeps ontheearth,
andevery man.
22Allonthedryland, inwhose nostrils
wasthebreath ofthespirit oflife,died.
23Every living thing was destroyed that
was onthesurface oftheground, includ-ingman, livestock, creeping things, and
birds ofthesky.They were destroyed from
theearth. Only Noah was left, and those
who were with him intheship.
24Thewaters flooded theearth onehun-
dred fifty days.
8
1God remembered Noah, alltheani-
mals, and allthelivestock that were with
him intheship; and God made awind to
pass over theearth. Thewaters subsided.
2Thedeep ’sfountains andthesky’swin-
dows were alsostopped, andtherain from
theskywasrestrained.
3The waters continually receded from
theearth. After theend ofone hundred
fifty days thewaters receded.
4Theship rested intheseventh month,
ontheseventeenth dayofthemonth, on
Ararat ’smountains.
5The waters receded continually until
thetenth month. Inthetenth month, on
thefirst dayofthemonth, thetops ofthe
mountains were visible.
6Attheendofforty days, Noah opened
the window ofthe ship which hehad
made,
7and hesent outaraven. Itwent back
and forth, until thewaters were dried up
from theearth.
8Hehimself sent outadove toseeifthe
waters were abated from thesurface ofthe
ground,
9butthedove found noplace toresther

forthewaters were onthesurface ofthe

her,andbrought hertohim into theship.
10Hewaited yetanother seven days; and
again hesent thedove outoftheship.
11Thedove came back tohim atevening
and, behold, inhermouth was afreshly
plucked olive leaf. SoNoah knew that the
waters were abated from theearth.
12Hewaited yetanother seven days, and
sent outthedove; andshedidn ’treturn to
him anymore.
13Inthesixhundred first year, inthe
first month, thefirst day ofthemonth,
thewaters were dried upfrom theearth.

Genesis 8:14 8 Genesis 9:20
Noah removed thecovering oftheship,
andlooked. Hesaw that thesurface ofthe
ground wasdry.
14Inthesecond month, onthetwenty-
seventh dayofthemonth, theearth was
dry.
15God spoke toNoah, saying,
16“Gooutoftheship, you, your wife,
your sons, andyour sons ’wives with you.
17Bring outwith youevery living thing
thatiswith youofallflesh, including birds,
livestock, and every creeping thing that
creeps ontheearth, that they may breed
abundantly intheearth, and befruitful,
andmultiply ontheearth. ”
18Noah went out,with hissons, hiswife,
andhissons ’wives with him.
19Every animal, every creeping thing,
and every bird, whatever moves onthe
earth, after their families, went outofthe
ship.
20Noah built analtar totheLORD, and
took ofevery clean animal, and ofevery
clean bird, andoffered burnt offerings on
thealtar.
21TheLORD smelled thepleasant aroma.
TheLORD said inhisheart, “Iwillnotagain
curse theground anymore forman ’ssake
because theimagination ofman ’sheart is
evil from hisyouth. Iwill never again
strike every living thing, asIhave done.
22While theearth remains, seed time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and sum-
mer andwinter, anddayandnight willnot
cease. ”
9
1God blessed Noah and hissons, and
said tothem, “Befruitful, multiply, and
replenish theearth.
2The fear ofyou and thedread ofyou
will beonevery animal oftheearth, and
onevery bird ofthesky. Everything that
moves along theground, andallthefishof
thesea,aredelivered into your hand.
3Every moving thing that lives will be
food foryou. AsIgave youthegreen herb,
Ihave given everything toyou.
4Butflesh with itslife,that is,itsblood,
youshall noteat.
5Iwill surely require accounting for
your life’sblood. Atthehand ofeveryanimal Iwillrequire it.Atthehand ofman,
even atthehand ofevery man ’sbrother, I
willrequire thelifeofman.
6Whoever sheds man ’sblood, hisblood
willbeshed byman, forGod made man in
hisown image.
7Befruitful and multiply. Increase
abundantly intheearth, and multiply in
it.”
8God spoke toNoah andtohissons with
him, saying,
9“Asforme, behold, Iestablish my
covenant with you, and with your off-
spring after you,
10and with every living creature that
iswith you: thebirds, thelivestock, and
every animal oftheearth with you, ofall
that gooutoftheship, even every animal
oftheearth.
11Iwillestablish mycovenant with you:
Allflesh willnotbecutoffanymore bythe
waters oftheflood. There willnever again
beaflood todestroy theearth. ”
12God said, “This isthetoken ofthe
covenant which Imake between meand
youand every living creature that iswith
you, forperpetual generations:
13Isetmyrainbow inthecloud, and it
will beasign ofacovenant between me
andtheearth.
14When Ibring acloud over theearth,
that therainbow willbeseen inthecloud,
15Iwill remember mycovenant, which
isbetween meand you and every living
creature ofallflesh, andthewaters willno
more become aflood todestroy allflesh.
16Therainbow willbeinthecloud. Iwill
look atit,that Imay remember theever-
lasting covenant between God and every
living creature ofallflesh that isonthe
earth. ”
17God said toNoah, “This isthetoken
ofthecovenant which Ihave established
between meand allflesh that isonthe
earth. ”
18Thesons ofNoah who went outfrom
theship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Ham isthefather ofCanaan.
19These three were thesons ofNoah,
and from these thewhole earth was pop-
ulated.
20Noah began tobeafarmer, and
planted avineyard.

22Ham, thefather ofCanaan, saw the
nakedness ofhisfather, and told histwo
brothers outside.
23Shem andJapheth took agarment, and
laid itonboth their shoulders, went in
backwards, andcovered thenakedness of
their father. Their faces were backwards,
and they didn ’tseetheir father ’snaked-
ness.
24Noah awoke from hiswine, andknew
what hisyoungest sonhaddone tohim.
25Hesaid,
“Canaan iscursed.

brothers. ”
26Hesaid,
“Blessed betheLORD, theGod ofShem.
LetCanaan behisservant.
27May God enlarge Japheth.
Lethim dwell inthetents ofShem.
LetCanaan behisservant. ”
28Noah lived three hundred fifty years
after theflood.
29Allthedays ofNoah were nine hun-
dred fifty years, andthen hedied.
10
1Now this isthehistory ofthegener-
ations ofthesons ofNoah and ofShem,
Ham, andJapheth. Sons were born tothem
after theflood.
2Thesons ofJapheth were: Gomer, Ma-
gog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and
Tiras.
3The sons ofGomer were: Ashkenaz,
Riphath, andTogarmah.
4The sons ofJavan were: Elishah,

5Ofthese were theislands ofthenations

6Thesons ofHam were: Cush, Mizraim,
Put,andCanaan.
7Thesons ofCush were: Seba, Havilah,
Sabtah, Raamah, andSabteca. Thesons of
Raamah were: Sheba andDedan.
8Cush became thefather ofNimrod. He
began tobeamighty oneintheearth.
9Hewas amighty hunter before the
LORD. Therefore itissaid, “likeNimrod, a
mighty hunter before theLORD ”.10Thebeginning ofhiskingdom wasBa-
bel,Erech, Accad, and Calneh, intheland
ofShinar.
11Outofthat land hewent into Assyria,
andbuilt Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,Calah,
12and Resen between Nineveh and the
great cityCalah.
13Mizraim became thefather ofLudim,
Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
14Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the
Philistines descended from), and Caph-
torim.
15Canaan became thefather ofSidon

16theJebusites, theAmorites, theGir-
gashites,
17theHivites, theArkites, theSinites,
18theArvadites, theZemarites, and the
Hamathites. Afterward thefamilies ofthe
Canaanites were spread abroad.
19The border ofthe Canaanites was
from Sidon —asyou gotoward Gerar —to
Gaza —asyou gotoward Sodom, Gomor-
rah, Admah, andZeboiim —toLasha.
20These arethesons ofHam, after their
families, according totheir languages, in
their lands andtheir nations.
21Children were also born toShem (the
elder brother ofJapheth), thefather ofall
thechildren ofEber.
22Thesons ofShem were: Elam, Asshur,
Arpachshad, Lud, andAram.
23The sons ofAram were: Uz, Hul,

26Joktan became thefather ofAlmodad,
Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
27Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
28Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
29Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. Allthese
were thesons ofJoktan.
30Their dwelling extended from Mesha,
asyougotoward Sephar, themountain of
theeast.
31These arethesons ofShem, bytheir
families, according totheir languages,
lands, andnations.
--- PAGE 14 ---
Genesis 10:32 10 Genesis 11:30
32These arethefamilies ofthesons of
Noah, bytheir generations, according to
their nations. The nations divided from
these intheearth after theflood.
11
1The whole earth was ofonelanguage
andofonespeech.
2Asthey traveled east, †they found a
plain intheland ofShinar, and they lived
there.
3They said tooneanother, “Come, let’s
make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. ”
They hadbrick forstone, andthey used tar
formortar.
4They said, “Come, let’sbuild ourselves a
city, andatower whose topreaches tothe
sky, and let’smake aname forourselves,
lestwebescattered abroad onthesurface
ofthewhole earth. ”
5The LORD came down toseethecity
and thetower, which thechildren ofmen
built.
6The LORD said, “Behold, they areone
people, and they allhave one language,
and this iswhat they begin todo. Now
nothing willbewithheld from them, which
they intend todo.
7Come, let’sgodown, andthere confuse
their language, that they may notunder-
stand oneanother ’sspeech. ”
8SotheLORD scattered them abroad
from there onthesurface ofalltheearth.
They stopped building thecity.
9Therefore itsname was called Babel,
because there theLORD confused thelan-
guage ofalltheearth. From there, the
LORD scattered them abroad onthesur-
face ofalltheearth.
10This isthehistory ofthegenerations
ofShem: Shem wasonehundred years old
when hebecame thefather ofArpachshad
twoyears after theflood.
11Shem lived fivehundred years after he
became thefather ofArpachshad, andbe-
came thefather ofmore sons and daugh-
ters.
12Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and
became thefather ofShelah.
13Arpachshad lived four hundred three
years after hebecame thefather ofShelah,and became thefather ofmore sons and
daughters.
14Shelah lived thirty years, andbecame
thefather ofEber.
15Shelah lived four hundred three years
after hebecame thefather ofEber, andbe-
came thefather ofmore sons and daugh-
ters.
16Eber lived thirty-four years, and be-
came thefather ofPeleg.
17Eber lived four hundred thirty years
after hebecame thefather ofPeleg, andbe-
came thefather ofmore sons and daugh-
ters.
18Peleg lived thirty years, and became
thefather ofReu.
19Peleg lived two hundred nine years
after hebecame thefather ofReu, andbe-
came thefather ofmore sons and daugh-
ters.
20Reu lived thirty-two years, and be-
came thefather ofSerug.
21Reulived twohundred seven years af-
terhebecame thefather ofSerug, andbe-
came thefather ofmore sons and daugh-
ters.
22Serug lived thirty years, and became

23Serug lived two hundred years after
hebecame thefather ofNahor, and be-

ters.
24Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and
became thefather ofTerah.
25Nahor lived one hundred nineteen
years after hebecame thefather ofTerah,
and became thefather ofmore sons and
daughters.
26Terah lived seventy years, andbecame
thefather ofAbram, Nahor, andHaran.
27Now thisisthehistory ofthegenera-
tions ofTerah. Terah became thefather of
Abram, Nahor, andHaran. Haran became
thefather ofLot.
28Haran died intheland ofhisbirth, in
UroftheChaldees, while hisfather Terah
wasstillalive.
29Abram andNahor married wives. The
name ofAbram ’swife was Sarai, and the
name ofNahor ’swife was Milcah, the
daughter ofHaran, who was also thefa-
ther ofIscah.
30Sarai wasbarren. Shehadnochild.
†11:2 LXX reads “from theeast ”.
--- PAGE 15 ---
Genesis 11:31 11 Genesis 13:5
31Terah took Abram hisson, Lotthe
son ofHaran, hisson ’sson, and Sarai
hisdaughter-in-law, hissonAbram ’swife.
They went from UroftheChaldees, togo
into theland ofCanaan. They came to
Haran andlived there.
32Thedays ofTerah were twohundred
fiveyears. Terah died inHaran.
12
1Now theLORD said toAbram, “Leave
your country, andyour relatives, andyour
father ’shouse, andgototheland thatIwill
show you.
2Iwillmake ofyouagreat nation. Iwill
bless youandmake your name great. You
willbeablessing.
3Iwill bless those who bless you, and
Iwill curse him who treats youwith con-
tempt. Allthefamilies oftheearth willbe
blessed through you. ”
4SoAbram went, astheLORD had told
him. Lotwent with him. Abram was
seventy-five years oldwhen hedeparted
from Haran.
5Abram took Sarai hiswife, Lot his
brother ’sson, alltheir possessions that
they had gathered, and thepeople whom
they hadacquired inHaran, andthey went
togointotheland ofCanaan. They entered
into theland ofCanaan.
6Abram passed through theland tothe
place ofShechem, totheoakofMoreh. At
that time, Canaanites were intheland.
7TheLORD appeared toAbram andsaid,
“Iwillgive thisland toyour offspring. ”†
Hebuilt analtar there totheLORD, who
hadappeared tohim.
8Heleftfrom there togotothemountain
ontheeast ofBethel and pitched histent,
having Bethel onthewest, and Aionthe
east. There hebuilt analtar totheLORD ‡
andcalled ontheLORD ’sname.
9Abram traveled, stillgoing ontoward
theSouth.
10There wasafamine intheland. Abram
went down intoEgypt toliveasaforeigner
there, forthefamine was severe inthe
land.
11When hehad come near toenter
Egypt, hesaid toSarai hiswife, “Seenow,Iknow that youareabeautiful woman to
look at.
12Itwillhappen thatwhen theEgyptians
seeyou, they will say, ‘This ishiswife. ’
They will killme, butthey will save you
alive.
13Please saythat youaremysister, that
itmay bewell with meforyour sake, and
that mysoul may livebecause ofyou. ”
14When Abram had come into Egypt,
some Egyptians saw that thewoman was
very beautiful.
15The princes ofPharaoh saw her, and
praised hertoPharaoh; and thewoman
wastaken into Pharaoh ’shouse.
16Hedealt well with Abram forher
sake. Hehadsheep, cattle, male donkeys,
male servants, female servants, female
donkeys, andcamels.
17The LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his
house with great plagues because ofSarai,
Abram ’swife.
18Pharaoh called Abram and said,
“What isthis that you have done tome?
Why didn ’tyoutellmethat shewas your
wife?
19Why didyou say, ‘She ismysister, ’
sothat Itook hertobemywife? Now
therefore, seeyour wife, take her, and go
your way. ”
20Pharaoh commanded men concerning
him, andthey escorted him away with his
wife andallthat hehad.
13
1Abram went upoutofEgypt —he,his
wife, allthat hehad, and Lotwith him —
into theSouth.
2Abram was very rich inlivestock, in
silver, andingold.
3Hewent onhisjourneys from theSouth
asfarasBethel, totheplace where histent
hadbeen atthebeginning, between Bethel
andAi,
4totheplace ofthealtar, which hehad
made there atthefirst. There Abram called
ontheLORD ’sname.
5Lotalso, who went with Abram, had
flocks, herds, andtents.
†12:7 or,seed ‡12:8 LORD orGOD inallcaps isfrom theHebrew יהוה Yahweh except when otherwise noted as

Genesis 13:6 12 Genesis 14:14
6Theland wasnotable tobear them, that
they might livetogether; fortheir posses-
sions were sogreat that they couldn ’tlive
together.
7There wasstrife between theherdsmen
ofAbram ’slivestock andtheherdsmen of
Lot’slivestock. The Canaanites and the
Perizzites lived intheland atthat time.
8Abram said toLot, “Please, letthere
benostrife between youand me,and be-
tween your herdsmen and myherdsmen;
forwearerelatives.
9Isn’tthewhole land before you? Please
separate yourself from me.Ifyougotothe
lefthand, then Iwill gototheright. Orif
yougototheright hand, then Iwill goto
theleft. ”
10Lotlifted uphiseyes, and saw all
theplain oftheJordan, that itwas well-
watered everywhere, before theLORD de-
stroyed Sodom andGomorrah, likethegar-
denoftheLORD, liketheland ofEgypt, as
yougotoZoar.
11SoLotchose thePlain oftheJordan
forhimself. Lottraveled east, and they
separated themselves from oneanother.
12Abram lived intheland ofCanaan,
andLotlived inthecities oftheplain, and
moved histent asfarasSodom.
13Now the men ofSodom were ex-
ceedingly wicked and sinners against the
LORD.
14TheLORD said toAbram, after Lotwas
separated from him, “Now, liftupyour
eyes, and look from theplace where you
are, northward and southward and east-
ward andwestward,
15forIwill give alltheland which you
seetoyouandtoyour offspring forever.
16Iwillmake your offspring asthedust
oftheearth, sothat ifaman cancount the
dust oftheearth, then your offspring may
also becounted.
17Arise, walk through theland inits
length andinitswidth; forIwillgive itto
you. ”
18Abram moved histent, andcame and
lived bytheoaks ofMamre, which arein
Hebron, and built analtar there tothe
LORD.
14
1Inthedays ofAmraphel, king ofShinar;Arioch, king ofEllasar; Chedorlaomer,
king ofElam; andTidal, king ofGoiim,
2they made war with Bera, king of
Sodom; Birsha, king ofGomorrah; Shinab,
king ofAdmah; Shemeber, king ofZe-
boiim; and theking ofBela (also called
Zoar).
3Allthese joined together inthevalley of
Siddim (also called theSaltSea).
4They served Chedorlaomer fortwelve
years, and inthethirteenth year they re-
belled.
5Inthefourteenth year Chedorlaomer
and thekings who were with him came
andstruck theRephaim inAshteroth Kar-
naim, theZuzim inHam, theEmim in
Shaveh Kiriathaim,
6and theHorites intheir Mount Seir, to
ElParan, which isbythewilderness.
7They returned, andcame toEnMishpat
(also called Kadesh), and struck allthe
country oftheAmalekites, and also the
Amorites, that lived inHazazon Tamar.
8The king ofSodom, and theking of
Gomorrah, theking ofAdmah, theking of
Zeboiim, and theking ofBela (also called
Zoar) went out; and they setthebattle in
array against them inthevalley ofSiddim
9against Chedorlaomer king ofElam,
Tidal king ofGoiim, Amraphel king ofShi-
nar,andArioch king ofEllasar; four kings
against thefive.
10Now thevalley ofSiddim wasfulloftar
pits; and thekings ofSodom and Gomor-
rahfled, and some fellthere. Those who
remained fledtothehills.
11They took allthegoods ofSodom and
Gomorrah, and alltheir food, and went
their way.
12They took Lot,Abram ’sbrother ’sson,
who lived inSodom, and hisgoods, and
departed.
13One who had escaped came and told
Abram, theHebrew. Atthat time, he
lived bytheoaks ofMamre, theAmorite,
brother ofEshcol and brother ofAner.
They were allies ofAbram.
14When Abram heard that hisrelative
was taken captive, heledouthisthree
hundred eighteen trained men, born inhis
house, andpursued asfarasDan.
--- PAGE 17 ---
Genesis 14:15 13 Genesis 15:19
15Hedivided himself against them by
night, heand hisservants, and struck
them, andpursued them toHobah, which
isonthelefthand ofDamascus.
16Hebrought back allthegoods, and
also brought back hisrelative Lotand his
goods, andthewomen also, andtheother
people.
17The king ofSodom went outtomeet
him after hisreturn from theslaughter
ofChedorlaomer and thekings who were
with him, atthevalley ofShaveh (that is,
theKing ’sValley).
18Melchizedek king ofSalem brought
outbread andwine. Hewas priest ofGod
Most High.
19Heblessed him, and said, “Blessed
beAbram ofGod Most High, possessor of
heaven andearth.
20Blessed beGod Most High, who has
delivered your enemies into your hand. ”
Abram gave him atenth ofall.
21The king ofSodom said toAbram,
“Give methepeople, andtake thegoods for
yourself. ”
22Abram said totheking ofSodom, “I
have lifted upmyhand totheLORD, God
Most High, possessor ofheaven andearth,
23that Iwill nottake athread nor a
sandal strap noranything thatisyours, lest
youshould say, ‘Ihave made Abram rich. ’
24Iwillaccept nothing from youexcept
that which theyoung men have eaten, and
theportion ofthemen who went with me:
Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Letthem take
their portion. ”
15
1After these things theLORD ’sword
came toAbram inavision, saying, “Don ’t
beafraid, Abram. Iamyour shield, your
exceedingly great reward. ”
2Abram said, “Lord †GOD, what willyou
give me, since Igochildless, and hewho
willinherit myestate isEliezer ofDamas-
cus? ”
3Abram said, “Behold, youhave given no
children tome: and, behold, oneborn in
myhouse ismyheir. ”4Behold, theLORD ’sword came tohim,
saying, “This man willnotbeyour heir, but
hewho will come outofyour own body
willbeyour heir. ”
5The LORD brought him outside, and
said, “Look now toward thesky,andcount
thestars, ifyouareable tocount them. ”He
said toAbram, “Soyour offspring willbe.”
6Hebelieved intheLORD, who credited
ittohim forrighteousness.
7Hesaid toAbram, “IamtheLORD who
brought you outofUroftheChaldees, to
give youthisland toinherit it.”
8Hesaid, “Lord GOD, how will Iknow
that Iwillinherit it?”
9Hesaid tohim, “Bring meaheifer three
years old, afemale goat three years old,
aram three years old,aturtledove, and a
young pigeon. ”
10Hebrought him allthese, anddivided
them inthemiddle, and laid each half
opposite theother; buthedidn ’tdivide the
birds.
11The birds ofprey came down onthe
carcasses, andAbram drove them away.
12When thesunwasgoing down, adeep
sleep fellonAbram. Now terror andgreat
darkness fellonhim.
13Hesaid toAbram, “Know forsure that
your offspring will liveasforeigners ina
land that isnottheirs, andwillserve them.
They willafflict them four hundred years.
14Iwill also judge that nation, whom
they willserve. Afterward they willcome
outwith great wealth;
15but you will gotoyour fathers in
peace. Youwillbeburied atagood oldage.
16Inthe fourth generation they will
come here again, fortheiniquity ofthe
Amorite isnotyetfull. ”
17Itcame topass that, when thesun
went down, and itwas dark, behold,
asmoking furnace and aflaming torch
passed between these pieces.
18Inthat daytheLORD made acovenant
with Abram, saying, “Ihave given thisland
toyour offspring, from theriver ofEgypt to
thegreat river, theriver Euphrates:
19theland oftheKenites, theKenizzites,
theKadmonites,
†15:2 Theword translated “Lord ”is“Adonai ”.

20the Hittites, the Perizzites, the
Rephaim,
21theAmorites, theCanaanites, theGir-
gashites, andtheJebusites. ”
16
1Now Sarai, Abram ’swife, bore him no
children. Shehad aservant, anEgyptian,
whose name wasHagar.
2Sarai said toAbram, “See now, the
LORD has restrained mefrom bearing.
Please gointomyservant. Itmay be
that Iwillobtain children byher. ”Abram
listened tothevoice ofSarai.
3Sarai, Abram ’swife, took Hagar the
Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had
lived tenyears intheland ofCanaan, and

wife.
4Hewent intoHagar, andsheconceived.
When shesawthat shehadconceived, her
mistress wasdespised inhereyes.
5Sarai said toAbram, “This wrong is
your fault. Igave myservant into your
bosom, and when shesaw that shehad
conceived, shedespised me.May theLORD
judge between meandyou. ”
6ButAbram said toSarai, “Behold, your
maid isinyour hand. Dotoherwhatever
isgood inyour eyes. ”Sarai dealt harshly
with her,andshefledfrom herface.
7TheLORD ’sangel found herbyafoun-
tain ofwater inthewilderness, bythe
fountain ontheway toShur.
8Hesaid, “Hagar, Sarai ’sservant, where
didyou come from? Where areyou go-
ing? ”
Shesaid, “Iamfleeing from theface of
mymistress Sarai. ”
9TheLORD ’sangel said toher, “Return to
your mistress, and submit yourself under
herhands. ”
10The LORD ’sangel said toher, “Iwill
greatly multiply your offspring, that they
willnotbecounted formultitude. ”
11TheLORD ’sangel said toher, “Behold,
youarewith child, andwillbear ason. You
shall callhisname Ishmael, because the
LORD hasheard your affliction.12Hewill belikeawild donkey among
men. Hishand willbeagainst every man,
andevery man ’shand against him. Hewill
liveopposed toallofhisbrothers. ”
13Shecalled thename oftheLORD who
spoke toher, “YouareaGod who sees, ”for
shesaid, “Have Ieven stayed alive after
seeing him? ”
14Therefore thewell was called Beer
Lahai Roi. †Behold, itisbetween Kadesh
andBered.
15Hagar bore asonforAbram. Abram
called thename ofhisson, whom Hagar
bore, Ishmael.
16Abram was eighty-six years oldwhen
Hagar bore Ishmael toAbram.
17
1When Abram was ninety-nine years
old,theLORD appeared toAbram andsaid
tohim, “IamGod Almighty. Walk before
meandbeblameless.
2Iwill make mycovenant between me
and you, and will multiply you exceed-
ingly. ”
3Abram fellonhisface. God talked with
him, saying,
4“Asforme,behold, mycovenant iswith
you. Youwillbethefather ofamultitude of
nations.
5Your name will nomore becalled
Abram, butyour name will beAbraham;
forIhave made youthefather ofamulti-
tude ofnations.
6Iwill make you exceedingly fruitful,
andIwillmake nations ofyou. Kings will
come outofyou.
7Iwill establish mycovenant between
meand you and your offspring after you
throughout their generations foranever-
lasting covenant, tobeaGod toyouandto
your offspring after you.
8Iwillgive toyou, andtoyour offspring
after you, theland where you aretravel-
ing,alltheland ofCanaan, foraneverlast-
ingpossession. Iwillbetheir God. ”
9God said toAbraham, “Asforyou, you
shall keep mycovenant, youandyour off-
spring after youthroughout their genera-
tions.
†16:14 Beer Lahai Roimeans “well oftheonewho lives andsees me”.
--- PAGE 19 ---
Genesis 17:10 15 Genesis 18:9
10This ismycovenant, which youshall
keep, between meand you and your off-
spring after you. Every male among you
shall becircumcised.
11You shall becircumcised intheflesh
ofyour foreskin. Itwill beatoken ofthe
covenant between meandyou.
12Hewho iseight days oldshall becir-
cumcised among you, every male through-
outyour generations, hewho isborn in
thehouse, orbought with money from any
foreigner who isnotofyour offspring.
13Hewho isborn inyour house, andhe
who isbought with your money, must be
circumcised. Mycovenant shall beinyour
flesh foraneverlasting covenant.
14The uncircumcised male who isnot
circumcised intheflesh ofhisforeskin,
that soul shall becutofffrom hispeople.
Hehasbroken mycovenant. ”
15God said toAbraham, “AsforSarai
your wife, you shall notcall her name
Sarai, buthername shall beSarah.
16Iwill bless her, and moreover Iwill
give youasonbyher. Yes,Iwillbless her,
andshewillbeamother ofnations. Kings
ofpeoples willcome from her. ”
17Then Abraham fellonhisface, and
laughed, andsaid inhisheart, “Will achild
beborn tohim who isonehundred years
old? Will Sarah, who isninety years old,
give birth? ”
18Abraham said toGod, “Ohthat Ish-
mael might livebefore you! ”
19God said, “No,butSarah, your wife,
willbear youason. Youshall callhisname
Isaac. †Iwill establish mycovenant with
him foraneverlasting covenant forhis
offspring after him.
20AsforIshmael, Ihave heard you. Be-
hold, Ihave blessed him, and will make
himfruitful, andwillmultiply himexceed-
ingly. Hewillbecome thefather oftwelve
princes, andIwillmake himagreat nation.
21ButIwillestablish mycovenant with
Isaac, whom Sarah willbear toyouatthis
settime next year. ”
22When hefinished talking with him,
God went upfrom Abraham.23Abraham took Ishmael hisson,allwho
were born inhishouse, and allwho were
bought with hismoney: every male among
themen ofAbraham ’shouse, andcircum-
cised theflesh oftheir foreskin inthesame
day, asGod hadsaid tohim.
24Abraham was ninety-nine years old
when hewascircumcised intheflesh ofhis
foreskin.
25Ishmael, hisson, was thirteen years
oldwhen hewas circumcised intheflesh
ofhisforeskin.
26Inthesame day both Abraham and
Ishmael, hisson, were circumcised.
27Allthemen ofhishouse, those born in
thehouse, and those bought with money
from aforeigner, were circumcised with
him.
18
1TheLORD appeared tohim bytheoaks
ofMamre, ashesatinthetent door inthe
heat oftheday.
2Helifted uphiseyes and looked, and
saw that three men stood near him. When
hesawthem, herantomeet them from the
tent door, andbowed himself totheearth,
3andsaid, “Mylord, ifnow Ihave found
favor inyour sight, please don ’tgoaway
from your servant.
4Now letalittle water befetched, wash
your feet, and rest yourselves under the
tree.
5Iwill getapiece ofbread soyou can
refresh your heart. After that youmay go
your way, now that youhave come toyour
servant. ”
They said, “Very well, doasyou have
said. ”
6Abraham hurried intothetenttoSarah,
andsaid, “Quickly prepare three seahs †of
finemeal, knead it,andmake cakes. ”
7Abraham rantotheherd, and fetched
atender and good calf, and gave ittothe
servant. Hehurried todress it.
8Hetook butter, milk, andthecalfwhich
hehaddressed, andsetitbefore them. He
stood bythem under thetree, andthey ate.
9They asked him, “Where isSarah, your
wife? ”
Hesaid, “There, inthetent. ”
†17:19 Isaac means “helaughs ”.†18:6 1seah isabout 7liters or1.9gallons or0.8pecks

Genesis 18:10 16 Genesis 19:2
10Hesaid, “Iwillcertainly return toyou
atabout thistime next year; and behold,
Sarah your wife willhave ason. ”
Sarah heard inthetent door, which was
behind him.
11Now Abraham and Sarah were old,
well advanced inage. Sarah had passed
theageofchildbearing.
12Sarah laughed within herself, saying,
“After Ihave grown oldwill Ihave plea-
sure, mylord being oldalso? ”
13TheLORD said toAbraham, “Why did
Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will Ireally bear a
child when Iamold? ’
14Isanything toohard fortheLORD? At
thesettime Iwillreturn toyou, when the
season comes around, andSarah willhave
ason. ”
15Then Sarah denied it,saying, “Ididn ’t
laugh, ”forshewasafraid.
Hesaid, “No,butyoudidlaugh. ”
16The men rose upfrom there, and
looked toward Sodom. Abraham went
with them toseethem ontheir way.
17TheLORD said, “Will Ihide from Abra-
ham what Ido,
18since Abraham will surely become a
great and mighty nation, and allthena-
tions oftheearth willbeblessed inhim?
19For Ihave known him, totheend
thathemay command hischildren andhis
household after him, that they may keep
theway oftheLORD, todorighteousness
andjustice; totheendthat theLORD may
bring onAbraham that which hehasspo-
kenofhim. ”
20The LORD said, “Because thecryof
Sodom and Gomorrah isgreat, and be-
cause their sinisvery grievous,
21Iwill godown now, and seewhether
their deeds areasbadasthereports which
have come tome.Ifnot,Iwillknow. ”
22Themen turned from there, andwent
toward Sodom, butAbraham stood yetbe-
fore theLORD.
23Abraham came near, and said, “Will
you consume the righteous with the
wicked?
24What ifthere arefifty righteous within
thecity? Will youconsume andnotspare
theplace forthefifty righteous who arein
it?25May itbefarfrom you todothings
like that, tokilltherighteous with the
wicked, sothat therighteous should be
like thewicked. May that befarfrom
you. Shouldn ’ttheJudge ofalltheearth do
right? ”
26TheLORD said, “IfIfind inSodom fifty
righteous within thecity, then Iwillspare
thewhole place fortheir sake. ”
27Abraham answered, “Seenow, Ihave
taken itonmyself tospeak totheLord,
although Iamdust andashes.
28What ifthere willlack fiveofthefifty
righteous? Will youdestroy allthecityfor
lack offive? ”
Hesaid, “Iwill notdestroy itifIfind
forty-five there. ”
29Hespoke tohim yetagain, and said,
“What ifthere areforty found there? ”
Hesaid, “Iwill notdoitfortheforty ’s

30Hesaid, “Ohdon ’tlettheLord bean-
gry, and Iwill speak. What ifthere are

Hesaid, “Iwill notdoitifIfind thirty

31Hesaid, “Seenow, Ihave taken iton

Hesaid, “Iwill notdestroy itforthe

32Hesaid, “Ohdon ’tlettheLord bean-

iftenarefound there? ”
Hesaid, “Iwillnotdestroy itfortheten’s

33TheLORD went hisway assoon ashe
had finished communing with Abraham,
andAbraham returned tohisplace.
19
1The two angels came toSodom at
evening. Lotsatinthegate ofSodom. Lot
saw them, and rose uptomeet them. He
bowed himself with hisface totheearth,
2andhesaid, “Seenow, mylords, please
come into your servant ’shouse, stay all
night, wash your feet, andyoucanriseup
early, andgoonyour way. ”
They said, “No,butwewill stay inthe
street allnight. ”

Genesis 19:3 17 Genesis 19:29
3Heurged them greatly, and they came
inwith him, andentered intohishouse. He
made them afeast, andbaked unleavened
bread, andthey ate.
4Butbefore they laydown, themen of
thecity,themen ofSodom, surrounded the
house, both young and old,allthepeople
from every quarter.
5They called toLot, and said tohim,
“Where arethemen who came intoyou
thisnight? Bring them outtous,that we
may have sexwith them. ”
6Lotwent outtothem through thedoor,
andshut thedoor after himself.
7Hesaid, “Please, mybrothers, don ’tact
sowickedly.
8Seenow, Ihave two virgin daughters.
Please letmebring them outtoyou, and
you may dotothem what seems good to
you. Only don ’tdoanything tothese men,
because they have come under theshadow
ofmyroof. ”
9They said, “Stand back! ”Then they
said, “This onefellow came intoliveasa
foreigner, andheappoints himself ajudge.
Now wewilldeal worse with youthan with
them! ”They pressed hard ontheman Lot,
andcame near tobreak thedoor.
10Butthemen reached outtheir hand,
and brought Lotinto thehouse tothem,
andshut thedoor.
11They struck themen who were atthe
door ofthehouse with blindness, both
small andgreat, sothatthey wearied them-
selves tofind thedoor.
12The men said toLot, “Doyou have
anybody elsehere? Sons-in-law, your sons,
your daughters, and whomever youhave
inthecity, bring them outoftheplace:
13forwewilldestroy thisplace, because
theoutcry against them hasgrown sogreat
before theLORD that theLORD hassent us
todestroy it.”
14Lotwent out, and spoke tohissons-
in-law, who were pledged tomarry his
daughters, and said, “Getup! Getoutof
this place, fortheLORD will destroy the
city! ”
Butheseemed tohissons-in-law tobe
joking.15When themorning came, then the
angels hurried Lot, saying, “Getup! Take
your wife andyour twodaughters who are
here, lestyoubeconsumed intheiniquity
ofthecity. ”
16Buthelingered; andthemen grabbed
hishand, hiswife ’shand, and histwo
daughters ’hands, theLORD being merci-
fultohim; and they took him out, and set
him outside ofthecity.
17Itcame topass, when they had taken
them out, that hesaid, “Escape foryour
life! Don ’tlook behind you, and don ’t
stay anywhere intheplain. Escape tothe
mountains, lestyoubeconsumed! ”
18Lotsaid tothem, “Oh,notso,mylord.
19Seenow, your servant hasfound favor
inyour sight, andyouhave magnified your
loving kindness, which youhave shown to
meinsaving mylife. Ican ’tescape tothe
mountain, lestevilovertake me,andIdie.
20Seenow, thiscityisnear tofleeto,and
itisalittle one. Ohletmeescape there
(isn ’titalittle one?), andmysoul willlive. ”
21Hesaid tohim, “Behold, Ihave granted
your request concerning this thing also,
that Iwillnotoverthrow thecityofwhich
youhave spoken.
22Hurry, escape there, forIcan ’tdoany-
thing until you getthere. ”Therefore the
name ofthecitywascalled Zoar. †
23Thesunhad risen ontheearth when
Lotcame toZoar.
24Then theLORD rained onSodom and
onGomorrah sulfur and fire from the
LORD outofthesky.
25Heoverthrew those cities, alltheplain,
alltheinhabitants ofthecities, and that
which grew ontheground.
26ButLot’swife looked back from be-
hind him, andshebecame apillar ofsalt.
27Abraham went upearly inthemorn-
ingtotheplace where hehadstood before
theLORD.
28Helooked toward Sodom andGomor-
rah, and toward alltheland oftheplain,
andsawthatthesmoke oftheland went up
asthesmoke ofafurnace.
29When God destroyed thecities ofthe
plain, God remembered Abraham, and
sent Lotoutofthemiddle oftheoverthrow,
†19:22 Zoar means “little ”.
--- PAGE 22 ---
Genesis 19:30 18 Genesis 20:17
when heoverthrew thecities inwhich Lot
lived.
30Lotwent upoutofZoar, and lived in
themountain, andhistwodaughters with
him; forhewas afraid toliveinZoar. He
lived inacave with histwodaughters.
31Thefirstborn said totheyounger, “Our
father isold,andthere isnotaman inthe
earth tocome intousintheway ofallthe
earth.
32Come, let’smake our father drink
wine, andwewillliewith him, thatwemay
preserve ourfather ’sfamily line. ”
33They made their father drink wine
that night: and thefirstborn went in,and
laywith herfather. Hedidn ’tknow when
shelaydown, norwhen shearose.
34Itcame topass onthenext day, that
thefirstborn said totheyounger, “Behold,
Ilaylastnight with myfather. Let’smake
him drink wine again tonight. Yougoin,
andliewith him, thatwemay preserve our
father ’sfamily line. ”
35They made their father drink wine
that night also. Theyounger went andlay
with him. Hedidn ’tknow when shelay
down, norwhen shegotup.
36Thus both ofLot’sdaughters were
with child bytheir father.
37The firstborn bore ason, and named
him Moab. Heisthefather oftheMoabites
tothisday.
38The younger also bore ason, and
called hisname BenAmmi. Heisthefather
ofthechildren ofAmmon tothisday.
20
1Abraham traveled from there toward
theland oftheSouth, and lived between
Kadesh and Shur. Helived asaforeigner
inGerar.
2Abraham said about Sarah hiswife,
“Sheismysister. ”Abimelech king ofGerar
sent, andtook Sarah.
3ButGod came toAbimelech inadream
ofthenight, andsaid tohim, “Behold, you
areadead man, because ofthewoman
whom you have taken; forsheisaman ’s
wife. ”
4Now Abimelech hadnotcome near her.
Hesaid, “Lord, will you killeven arigh-
teous nation?5Didn ’thetellme, ‘Sheismysister ’?She,
even sheherself, said, ‘Heismybrother. ’I
have done thisintheintegrity ofmyheart
andtheinnocence ofmyhands. ”
6God said tohim inthedream, “Yes, I
know that intheintegrity ofyour heart
you have done this, and Ialso withheld
youfrom sinning against me. Therefore I
didn ’tallow youtotouch her.
7Now therefore, restore theman ’swife.
Forheisaprophet, and hewill pray for
you, andyouwilllive. Ifyoudon ’trestore
her, know forsure that you will die,you,
andallwho areyours. ”
8Abimelech rose early inthemorning,
and called allhisservants, and told all
these things intheir ear. The men were
very scared.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and
said tohim, “What have you done tous?
How have Isinned against you, that you
have brought onmeandonmykingdom a
great sin? Youhave done deeds tomethat
ought nottobedone! ”
10Abimelech said toAbraham, “What
didyousee,thatyouhave done thisthing? ”
11Abraham said, “Because Ithought,
‘Surely thefear ofGod isnotinthisplace.
They willkillmeformywife ’ssake. ’
12Besides, sheisindeed mysister, the
daughter ofmyfather, butnotthedaugh-
terofmymother; andshebecame mywife.
13When God caused metowander from
myfather ’shouse, Isaid toher, ‘This is
your kindness which youshall show tome.
Everywhere that wego,sayofme, “Heis
mybrother. ” ’ ”
14Abimelech took sheep andcattle, male
servants and female servants, and gave
them toAbraham, andrestored Sarah, his
wife, tohim.
15Abimelech said, “Behold, myland is
before you. Dwell where itpleases you. ”
16ToSarah hesaid, “Behold, Ihave given
your brother athousand pieces ofsilver.
Behold, itisforyouacovering oftheeyes
toallthat arewith you. Infront ofallyou
arevindicated. ”
17Abraham prayed toGod. SoGod
healed Abimelech, hiswife, andhisfemale
servants, andthey bore children.
--- PAGE 23 ---
Genesis 20:18 19 Genesis 21:29
18FortheLORD had closed uptight all
thewombs ofthehouse ofAbimelech, be-
cause ofSarah, Abraham ’swife.
21
1TheLORD visited Sarah ashehadsaid,
and theLORD didtoSarah ashehad spo-
ken.
2Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a
soninhisoldage, atthesettime ofwhich
God hadspoken tohim.
3Abraham called hissonwho was born
tohim, whom Sarah bore tohim, Isaac. †
4Abraham circumcised hisson, Isaac,
when hewas eight days old, asGod had
commanded him.
5Abraham was one hundred years old
when hisson, Isaac, wasborn tohim.
6Sarah said, “God hasmade melaugh.
Everyone who hears willlaugh with me. ”
7She said, “Who would have said to
Abraham that Sarah would nurse chil-
dren? ForIhave borne himasoninhisold
age. ”
8Thechild grew andwasweaned. Abra-
ham made agreat feast ontheday that
Isaac wasweaned.
9Sarah saw thesonofHagar theEgyp-
tian, whom shehad borne toAbraham,
mocking.
10Therefore shesaid toAbraham, “Cast
outthisservant and herson! Fortheson
ofthisservant willnotbeheir with myson,
Isaac. ”
11Thething was very grievous inAbra-
ham ’ssight onaccount ofhisson.
12God said toAbraham, “Don ’tletit
begrievous inyour sight because ofthe
boy, and because ofyour servant. Inall
that Sarah says toyou, listen tohervoice.
Foryour offspring willbenamed through
Isaac.
13Iwillalso make anation ofthesonof
theservant, because heisyour child. ”
14Abraham rose upearly inthemorn-
ing,andtook bread andacontainer ofwa-
ter,and gave ittoHagar, putting itonher
shoulder; andgave herthechild, andsent
heraway. Shedeparted, andwandered in
thewilderness ofBeersheba.15Thewater inthecontainer was spent,
and she putthechild under one ofthe
shrubs.
16Shewent andsatdown opposite him,
agood way off,about abow shot away. For
shesaid, “Don ’tletmeseethedeath ofthe
child. ”Shesatopposite him, andlifted up
hervoice, andwept.
17God heard thevoice oftheboy.
Theangel ofGod called toHagar outof
thesky, and said toher, “What troubles
you, Hagar? Don ’tbeafraid. ForGod has
heard thevoice oftheboywhere heis.
18Getup,liftuptheboy, and hold him
with your hand. ForIwillmake himagreat
nation. ”
19God opened hereyes, and shesaw a
well ofwater. She went, filled thecon-
tainer with water, and gave theboy a
drink.
20Godwaswith theboy,andhegrew. He
lived inthewilderness, andashegrew up,
hebecame anarcher.
21Helived inthewilderness ofParan.
Hismother gotawife forhim outofthe
land ofEgypt.
22Atthat time, Abimelech and Phicol
thecaptain ofhisarmy spoke toAbraham,
saying, “God iswith youinallthat youdo.
23Now, therefore, swear tomehere by
God that you will notdeal falsely with
me, norwith myson, norwith myson ’s
son. Butaccording tothekindness that I
have done toyou, youshall dotome,and
totheland inwhich you have lived asa
foreigner. ”
24Abraham said, “Iwillswear. ”
25Abraham complained toAbimelech
because ofawater well, which Abim-
elech ’sservants hadviolently taken away.
26Abimelech said, “Idon ’tknow who has
done thisthing. You didn ’ttellme,and I
didn ’thear ofituntil today. ”
27Abraham took sheep and cattle, and
gave them toAbimelech. Those twomade
acovenant.
28Abraham setseven ewe lambs ofthe
flock bythemselves.
29Abimelech said toAbraham, “What do
these seven ewe lambs, which youhave set
bythemselves, mean? ”
†21:3 Isaac means “Helaughs ”.

Genesis 21:30 20 Genesis 22:20
30Hesaid, “You shall take these seven
ewe lambs from myhand, that itmay bea
witness tome,that Ihave dugthiswell. ”
31Therefore hecalled that place Beer-
sheba, ‡because they both swore anoath
there.
32Sothey made acovenant atBeersheba.
Abimelech rose upwith Phicol, thecaptain
ofhisarmy, and they returned into the
land ofthePhilistines.
33Abraham planted atamarisk tree in
Beersheba, and there hecalled onthe
name oftheLORD, §theEverlasting God.
34Abraham lived asaforeigner inthe
land ofthePhilistines many days.
22
1After these things, God tested Abra-
ham, andsaid tohim, “Abraham! ”
Hesaid, “Here Iam. ”
2Hesaid, “Now take your son, your only
son, Isaac, whom youlove, andgointo the
land ofMoriah. Offer him there asaburnt
offering ononeofthemountains which I
willtellyouof.”
3Abraham rose early inthemorning,
and saddled hisdonkey; and took two of
hisyoung men with him, andIsaac hisson.
Hesplit thewood fortheburnt offering,
androse up,andwent totheplace ofwhich
God hadtoldhim.
4Onthethird dayAbraham lifted uphis
eyes, andsawtheplace faroff.
5Abraham said tohisyoung men, “Stay
here with thedonkey. The boyand Iwill
goover there. Wewillworship, andcome
back toyou. ”
6Abraham took thewood oftheburnt
offering and laid itonIsaac hisson. He
took inhishand thefire and theknife.
They both went together.
7Isaac spoke toAbraham hisfather, and
said, “Myfather? ”
Hesaid, “Here Iam,myson. ”
Hesaid, “Here isthefireand thewood,
butwhere isthelamb foraburnt offer-
ing? ”8Abraham said, “God will provide him-
selfthelamb foraburnt offering, myson. ”
Sothey both went together.
9They came totheplace which God had
toldhim of.Abraham built thealtar there,
andlaidthewood inorder, bound Isaac his
son, andlaidhimonthealtar, onthewood.
10Abraham stretched outhishand, and
took theknife tokillhisson.
11TheLORD ’sangel called tohim outof
thesky,andsaid, “Abraham, Abraham! ”
Hesaid, “Here Iam. ”
12Hesaid, “Don ’tlayyour hand onthe
boy ordoanything tohim. Fornow I
know that you fear God, since you have
notwithheld your son, your only son, from
me. ”
13Abraham lifted uphis eyes, and
looked, and saw that behind him was a
ram caught inthethicket byhishorns.
Abraham went and took theram, and
offered himupforaburnt offering instead
ofhisson.
14Abraham called thename ofthatplace
“TheLORD Will Provide ”.†Asitissaid to
thisday, “OntheLORD ’smountain, itwill
beprovided. ”
15TheLORD ’sangel called toAbraham a
second time outofthesky,
16and said, “ ‘Ihave sworn bymyself, ’
says theLORD, ‘because you have done
thisthing, andhave notwithheld your son,
your only son,
17that Iwill bless you greatly, and I
will multiply your offspring greatly like
thestars oftheheavens, andlikethesand
which isontheseashore. Your offspring
willpossess thegate ofhisenemies.
18Allthenations oftheearth will be
blessed byyour offspring, because you
have obeyed myvoice. ’ ”
19SoAbraham returned tohisyoung
men, and they rose upand went together
toBeersheba. Abraham lived atBeer-
sheba.
20After these things, Abraham was told,
“Behold, Milcah, shealso hasborne chil-
dren toyour brother Nahor:

22Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and
Bethuel. ”
23Bethuel became thefather ofRebekah.
These eight Milcah bore toNahor, Abra-
ham ’sbrother.
24His concubine, whose name was
Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash,
andMaacah.

1Sarah lived onehundred twenty-seven
years. This wasthelength ofSarah ’slife.
2Sarah died inKiriath Arba (also called
Hebron), intheland ofCanaan. Abraham
came tomourn forSarah, andtoweep for
her.
3Abraham rose upfrom before hisdead
andspoke tothechildren ofHeth, saying,
4“Iamastranger and aforeigner liv-
ingwith you. Give meapossession ofa
burying-place with you, that Imay bury
mydead outofmysight. ”
5The children ofHeth answered Abra-
ham, saying tohim,
6“Hear us,mylord. You areaprince
ofGod among us.Bury your dead inthe
best ofourtombs. None ofuswillwithhold
from youhistomb. Bury your dead. ”
7Abraham rose up,and bowed himself
tothepeople oftheland, tothechildren of
Heth.
8Hetalked with them, saying, “Ifyou
agree that Ishould bury mydead outof
mysight, hear me, and entreat formeto
Ephron thesonofZohar,
9that hemay sellmethecave ofMach-
pelah, which hehas, which isintheendof
hisfield. Forthefullprice lethim sellitto
meamong youasapossession foraburial
place. ”
10Now Ephron was sitting inthemiddle
ofthechildren ofHeth. Ephron theHittite
answered Abraham inthehearing ofthe
children ofHeth, even ofallwho went in
atthegate ofhiscity, saying,
11“No,mylord, hear me. Igive youthe
field, andIgive youthecave that isinit.In
thepresence ofthechildren ofmypeople I
give ittoyou. Bury your dead. ”12Abraham bowed himself down before
thepeople oftheland.
13Hespoke toEphron intheaudience of
thepeople oftheland, saying, “Butifyou
will, please hear me.Iwillgive theprice of
thefield. Take itfrom me,and Iwillbury
mydead there. ”
14Ephron answered Abraham, saying to
him,
15“Mylord, listen tome. What isa
piece ofland worth four hundred shekels
ofsilver †between meandyou? Therefore
bury your dead. ”
16Abraham listened toEphron. Abra-
ham weighed toEphron thesilver which
hehad named inthehearing ofthechil-
dren ofHeth, four hundred shekels ofsil-
ver, according tothecurrent merchants ’
standard.
17Sothefield ofEphron, which was in
Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the
field, thecave which was init,and allthe
trees that were inthefield, that were inall
ofitsborders, were deeded
18toAbraham forapossession inthe
presence ofthechildren ofHeth, before all
who went inatthegate ofhiscity.
19After this, Abraham buried Sarah his
wife inthecave ofthefield ofMachpelah
before Mamre (that is,Hebron), intheland
ofCanaan.
20The field, and thecave that isinit,
were deeded toAbraham bythechildren
ofHeth asapossession foraburial place.

1Abraham was old, and well advanced
inage. TheLORD hadblessed Abraham in
allthings.
2Abraham said tohisservant, theel-
derofhishouse, who ruled over allthat
hehad, “Please putyour hand under my
thigh.
3Iwillmake youswear bytheLORD, the
God ofheaven and theGod oftheearth,
that you shall nottake awife formyson
ofthedaughters oftheCanaanites, among

5The servant said tohim, “What ifthe
woman isn’twilling tofollow metothis
land? Must Ibring your sonagain tothe
land youcame from? ”
6Abraham said tohim, “Beware thatyou
don ’tbring mysonthere again.
7The LORD, theGod ofheaven —who
took mefrom myfather ’shouse, andfrom
theland ofmybirth, who spoke tome,
and who swore tome,saying, ‘Iwill give

angel before you, andyoushall take awife
formysonfrom there.
8Ifthewoman isn’twilling tofollow you,
then you shall beclear from this oath to
me.Only youshall notbring mysonthere
again. ”
9The servant puthishand under the
thigh ofAbraham hismaster, andswore to
him concerning thismatter.
10The servant took tenofhismaster ’s
camels, and departed, having avariety of
good things ofhismaster ’swith him. He
arose, and went toMesopotamia, tothe
cityofNahor.
11Hemade thecamels kneel down out-
sidethecitybythewell ofwater atthetime
ofevening, thetime that women gooutto
draw water.
12Hesaid, “LORD, theGod ofmymaster
Abraham, please give mesuccess today,
and show kindness tomymaster Abra-
ham.
13Behold, Iamstanding bythespring of
water. Thedaughters ofthemen ofthecity
arecoming outtodraw water.
14Letithappen, that theyoung lady to

‘Drink, and Iwill also give your camels a
drink, ’—letherbetheone you have ap-
pointed foryour servant Isaac. Bythis I
willknow thatyouhave shown kindness to
mymaster. ”
15Before hehad finished speaking, be-
hold, Rebekah came out,who was born toBethuel thesonofMilcah, thewife ofNa-
hor, Abraham ’sbrother, with herpitcher
onhershoulder.
16Theyoung lady was very beautiful to
look at,avirgin. Noman had known her.
She went down tothespring, filled her
pitcher, andcame up.
17Theservant rantomeet her,andsaid,
“Please give meadrink, alittle water from
your pitcher. ”
18Shesaid, “Drink, mylord. ”Shehur-
ried, andletdown herpitcher onherhand,
andgave him adrink.
19When shehad finished giving him a
drink, shesaid, “Iwill also draw foryour
camels, until they have finished drinking. ”
20Shehurried, andemptied herpitcher
into thetrough, and ranagain tothewell
todraw, anddrew forallhiscamels.
21Theman looked steadfastly ather,re-
maining silent, toknow whether theLORD
hadmade hisjourney prosperous ornot.
22Asthecamels had finished drinking,
theman took agolden ring ofhalfashekel †
weight, andtwobracelets forherhands of
tenshekels weight ofgold,
23and said, “Whose daughter areyou?
Please tellme. Isthere room inyour fa-

24Shesaid tohim, “Iamthedaughter of
Bethuel thesonofMilcah, whom shebore
toNahor. ”
25Shesaid moreover tohim, “Wehave
both straw and feed enough, and room to
lodge in.”
26The man bowed hishead, and wor-
shiped theLORD.
27Hesaid, “Blessed betheLORD, the
God ofmymaster Abraham, who hasnot
forsaken hisloving kindness andhistruth
toward mymaster. Asforme, theLORD
hasledmeontheway tothehouse ofmy
master ’srelatives. ”
28The young lady ran, and told her
mother ’shouse about these words.
29Rebekah hadabrother, andhisname
was Laban. Laban ranouttotheman, to
thespring.
30When hesaw the ring, and the

Genesis 24:31 23 Genesis 24:55
heheard thewords ofRebekah hissister,
saying, “This iswhat theman said tome, ”
hecame totheman. Behold, hewas
standing bythecamels atthespring.
31Hesaid, “Come in,youblessed ofthe
LORD. Why doyou stand outside? ForI
have prepared thehouse, androom forthe
camels. ”
32Theman came into thehouse, andhe
unloaded thecamels. Hegave straw and
feed forthecamels, andwater towash his
feetandthefeetofthemen who were with
him.
33Food was setbefore him toeat,buthe
said, “Iwill noteatuntil Ihave told my
message. ”
Laban said, “Speak on.”
34Hesaid, “IamAbraham ’sservant.
35The LORD has blessed my master
greatly. Hehasbecome great. The LORD
hasgiven him flocks andherds, silver and
gold, male servants and female servants,
andcamels anddonkeys.
36Sarah, mymaster ’swife, bore asonto
mymaster when shewasold.Hehasgiven
allthat hehastohim.
37Mymaster made meswear, saying,
‘Youshall nottake awife formysonfrom

39Iasked mymaster, ‘What ifthewoman
willnotfollow me? ’
40Hesaid tome, ‘The LORD, before

and prosper your way. You shall take a

41Then youwillbeclear from myoath,
when you come tomyrelatives. Ifthey
don ’tgive hertoyou, you shall beclear

42Icame today tothespring, and said,
‘The LORD, theGod ofmymaster Abra-

44then shetells me, “Drink, and Iwill

45Before Ihad finished speaking inmy
heart, behold, Rebekah came outwith her

46Shehurried and letdown herpitcher

Idrank, and shealso gave thecamels a

47Iasked her, and said, ‘Whose daugh-
terareyou? ’She said, ‘The daughter of
Bethuel, Nahor ’sson,whom Milcah bore to

bracelets onherhands.
48Ibowed myhead, and worshiped the

daughter forhisson.
49Now ifyouwill deal kindly and truly
with mymaster, tellme.Ifnot,tellme,that

50Then Laban and Bethuel answered,
“The thing proceeds from theLORD. We
can ’tspeak toyoubadorgood.
51Behold, Rebekah isbefore you. Take
her, and go,and letherbeyour master ’s
son ’swife, astheLORD hasspoken. ”
52When Abraham ’sservant heard their
words, hebowed himself down tothe
earth totheLORD.
53The servant brought out jewels of
silver, and jewels ofgold, and clothing,
and gave them toRebekah. Healso gave
precious things toher brother and her
mother.
54They ateand drank, heand themen
who were with him, and stayed allnight.
They rose upinthemorning, andhesaid,
“Send meaway tomymaster. ”
55Herbrother andhermother said, “Let
theyoung lady stay with usafewdays, at
least ten.After that shewillgo.”

Genesis 24:56 24 Genesis 25:21
56Hesaid tothem, “Don ’thinder me,
since theLORD has prospered myway.
Send meaway that Imay gotomymaster. ”
57They said, “Wewillcalltheyoung lady,
andaskher. ”
58They called Rebekah, and said toher,
“Will yougowith thisman? ”
Shesaid, “Iwillgo.”
59They sent away Rebekah, their sister,
with hernurse, Abraham ’sservant, and
hismen.
60They blessed Rebekah, and said to
her, “Our sister, may youbethemother of
thousands oftenthousands, and letyour
offspring possess thegate ofthose who
hate them. ”
61Rebekah arose with herladies. They
rode onthecamels, andfollowed theman.
The servant took Rebekah, and went his
way.
62Isaac came from theway ofBeer Lahai
Roi,forhelived intheland oftheSouth.
63Isaac went outtomeditate inthefield
attheevening. Helifted uphiseyes and
looked. Behold, there were camels com-
ing.
64Rebekah lifted uphereyes, andwhen
shesawIsaac, shegotoffthecamel.
65She said totheservant, “Who isthe
man who iswalking inthefield tomeet
us?”
Theservant said, “Itismymaster. ”
Shetook herveil, andcovered herself.
66The servant told Isaac allthethings
that hehaddone.
67Isaac brought her into hismother
Sarah ’stent, and took Rebekah, and she
became hiswife. Heloved her. SoIsaac
wascomforted after hismother ’sdeath.
25
1Abraham took another wife, and her
name wasKeturah.
2Shebore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan,
Midian, Ishbak, andShuah.
3Jokshan became thefather ofSheba,
and Dedan. The sons ofDedan were
Asshurim, Letushim, andLeummim.
4Thesons ofMidian were Ephah, Epher,
Hanoch, Abida, andEldaah. Allthese were
thechildren ofKeturah.
5Abraham gave allthat hehadtoIsaac,6but Abraham gave gifts tothesons
ofAbraham ’sconcubines. While hestill
lived, hesent them away from Isaac his
son, eastward, totheeast country.
7These arethedays oftheyears ofAbra-
ham ’slifewhich helived: one hundred
seventy-five years.
8Abraham gave uphisspirit, and died
atagood oldage, anoldman, and fullof
years, andwasgathered tohispeople.
9Isaac andIshmael, hissons, buried him
inthecave ofMachpelah, inthefield of
Ephron, thesonofZohar theHittite, which
isnear Mamre,
10thefield which Abraham purchased
from thechildren ofHeth. Abraham was
buried there with Sarah, hiswife.
11After the death ofAbraham, God
blessed Isaac, hisson. Isaac lived byBeer
Lahai Roi.
12Now this isthehistory ofthegener-
ations ofIshmael, Abraham ’sson, whom
Hagar theEgyptian, Sarah ’sservant, bore
toAbraham.
13These arethenames ofthesons ofIsh-
mael, bytheir names, according totheor-
deroftheir birth: thefirstborn ofIshmael,
Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
14Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
15Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and
Kedemah.
16These arethesons ofIshmael, and
these aretheir names, bytheir villages,
and bytheir encampments: twelve
princes, according totheir nations.
17These aretheyears ofthelifeofIsh-
mael: onehundred thirty-seven years. He
gave uphisspirit and died, and was gath-
ered tohispeople.
18They lived from Havilah toShur thatis
before Egypt, asyougotoward Assyria. He
lived opposite allhisrelatives.
19This isthehistory ofthegenerations
ofIsaac, Abraham ’sson. Abraham became
thefather ofIsaac.
20Isaac was forty years oldwhen he
took Rebekah, thedaughter ofBethuel the
Syrian ofPaddan Aram, thesister ofLaban
theSyrian, tobehiswife.
21Isaac entreated theLORD forhiswife,
because shewas barren. The LORD was
--- PAGE 29 ---
Genesis 25:22 25 Genesis 26:16
entreated byhim, and Rebekah hiswife
conceived.
22The children struggled together
within her. Shesaid, “Ifitislikethis, why
doIlive? ”Shewent toinquire oftheLORD.
23TheLORD said toher,
“Two nations areinyour womb.
Two peoples will beseparated from your
body.
The one people will bestronger than the
other people.
Theelder willserve theyounger. ”
24When herdays tobedelivered were
fulfilled, behold, there were twins inher
womb.
25The first came outredallover, likea
hairy garment. They named him Esau.
26After that, hisbrother came out, and
hishand hadhold onEsau ’sheel. Hewas
named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old
when shebore them.
27The boys grew. Esau was askillful
hunter, aman ofthefield. Jacob was a
quiet man, living intents.
28Now Isaac loved Esau, because heate
hisvenison. Rebekah loved Jacob.
29Jacob boiled stew. Esau came infrom
thefield, andhewasfamished.
30Esau said toJacob, “Please feed me
with some ofthat redstew, forIamfam-
ished. ”Therefore hisname was called
Edom. †
31Jacob said, “First, sell me your
birthright. ”
32Esau said, “Behold, Iamabout todie.
What good isthebirthright tome? ”
33Jacob said, “Swear tomefirst. ”
Heswore tohim. Hesold hisbirthright
toJacob.
34Jacob gave Esau bread andlentil stew.
Heateand drank, rose up,and went his
way. SoEsau despised hisbirthright.
26
1There was afamine intheland, in
addition tothefirst famine that was inthe
days ofAbraham. Isaac went toAbimelech
king ofthePhilistines, toGerar.
2The LORD appeared tohim, and said,
“Don ’tgodown intoEgypt. Live intheland
Iwilltellyouabout.3Live inthisland, andIwillbewith you,
and will bless you. ForIwill give toyou,
and toyour offspring, allthese lands, and
Iwill establish theoath which Iswore to
Abraham your father.
4Iwill multiply your offspring asthe
stars ofthesky,andwillgive allthese lands
toyour offspring. Inyour offspring allthe
nations oftheearth willbeblessed,
5because Abraham obeyed myvoice,
andkept myrequirements, mycommand-
ments, mystatutes, andmylaws. ”
6Isaac lived inGerar.
7Themen oftheplace asked him about
hiswife. Hesaid, “She ismysister, ”for
hewas afraid tosay, “Mywife ”,lest, he
thought, “themen oftheplace might kill
meforRebekah, because sheisbeautiful to
look at.”
8When hehad been there along time,
Abimelech king ofthePhilistines looked
outatawindow, and saw, and, behold,
Isaac wascaressing Rebekah, hiswife.
9Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Be-
hold, surely sheisyour wife. Why didyou
say, ‘Sheismysister ’?”
Isaac said tohim, “Because Isaid, ‘Lest I
diebecause ofher. ’ ”
10Abimelech said, “What isthisyouhave
done tous?One ofthepeople might easily
have lain with your wife, and you would
have brought guilt onus!”
11Abimelech commanded allthepeople,
saying, “Hewho touches this man orhis
wife willsurely beputtodeath. ”
12Isaac sowed inthat land, and reaped
inthesame year onehundred times what
heplanted. TheLORD blessed him.
13The man grew great, and grew more
andmore until hebecame very great.
14Hehad possessions offlocks, posses-
sions ofherds, andagreat household. The
Philistines envied him.
15Now allthewells which hisfather ’s
servants had duginthedays ofAbraham
hisfather, thePhilistines hadstopped, and
filled with earth.
16Abimelech said toIsaac, “Goaway
from us,foryou aremuch mightier than
we.”
†25:30 “Edom ”means “red”.
--- PAGE 30 ---
Genesis 26:17 26 Genesis 27:9
17Isaac departed from there, encamped
inthevalley ofGerar, andlived there.
18Isaac dug again thewells ofwater,
which they had dug inthedays ofAbra-
ham hisfather, forthe Philistines had
stopped them after thedeath ofAbraham.
Hecalled their names after thenames by
which hisfather hadcalled them.
19Isaac ’sservants duginthevalley, and
found there awell offlowing †water.
20The herdsmen ofGerar argued with
Isaac ’sherdsmen, saying, “The water is
ours. ”Sohecalled thename ofthewell
Esek, ‡because they contended with him.
21They dug another well, and they ar-
gued over that, also. Sohecalled itsname
Sitnah. §
22Heleftthat place, and dug another
well. They didn ’targue over that one. So
hecalled itRehoboth. †Hesaid, “Fornow
theLORD hasmade room forus,and we
willbefruitful intheland. ”
23Hewent upfrom there toBeersheba.
24The LORD appeared tohim thesame
night, andsaid, “IamtheGod ofAbraham
your father. Don ’tbeafraid, forIamwith
you, andwillbless you, andmultiply your
offspring formyservant Abraham ’ssake. ”
25Hebuilt analtar there, and called
ontheLORD ’sname, and pitched histent
there. There Isaac ’sservants dugawell.
26Then Abimelech went tohim from
Gerar with Ahuzzath hisfriend, andPhicol
thecaptain ofhisarmy.
27Isaac said tothem, “Why have you
come tome,since youhate me,and have
sent meaway from you? ”
28They said, “Wesaw plainly that the
LORD was with you. Wesaid, ‘Letthere
now beanoath between us,even between
usandyou, andlet’smake acovenant with
you,
29thatyouwilldousnoharm, aswehave
nottouched you, and aswehave done to
you nothing butgood, and have sent you
away inpeace. ’Youarenow theblessed of
theLORD. ”
30Hemade them afeast, andthey ateand
drank.31They rose upsome time inthemorn-
ing, and swore anoath toone another.
Isaac sent them away, and they departed
from him inpeace.
32The same day, Isaac ’sservants came,
and told him concerning thewell which
they had dug, and said tohim, “Wehave
found water. ”
33Hecalled it“Shibah ”.‡Therefore the
name ofthecity is“Beersheba ”§tothis
day.
34When Esau was forty years old, he
took aswife Judith, thedaughter ofBeeri
theHittite, andBasemath, thedaughter of
Elon theHittite.
35They grieved Isaac ’sand Rebekah ’s
spirits.
27
1When Isaac was old,andhiseyes were
dim, sothathecould notsee,hecalled Esau
hiselder son, andsaid tohim, “Myson? ”
Hesaid tohim, “Here Iam. ”
2Hesaid, “Seenow, Iamold. Idon ’t
know thedayofmydeath.
3Now therefore, please take your
weapons, your quiver and your bow, and
goouttothefield, andgetmevenison.
4Make mesavory food, such asIlove,
andbring ittome,that Imay eat,andthat
mysoul may bless youbefore Idie. ”
5Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to
Esau hisson. Esau went tothefield tohunt
forvenison, andtobring it.
6Rebekah spoke toJacob herson, saying,
“Behold, Iheard your father speak toEsau
your brother, saying,
7‘Bring mevenison, and make mesa-
vory food, that Imay eat, and bless you
before theLORD before mydeath. ’
8Now therefore, myson, obey myvoice
according tothat which Icommand you.
9Gonow totheflock and getmetwo
good young goats from there. Iwillmake
them savory food foryour father, such as
heloves.

10You shall bring ittoyour father, that
hemay eat,sothathemay bless youbefore
hisdeath. ”
11Jacob said toRebekah hismother, “Be-
hold, Esau mybrother isahairy man, and
Iamasmooth man.
12What ifmyfather touches me? Iwill
seem tohim asadeceiver, and Iwould
bring acurse onmyself, and notabless-
ing. ”
13His mother said tohim, “Letyour
curse beonme, myson. Only obey my
voice, andgogetthem forme. ”
14Hewent, and gotthem, and brought
them tohismother. Hismother made
savory food, such ashisfather loved.
15Rebekah took thegood clothes ofEsau,
herelder son, which were with herinthe
house, andputthem onJacob, heryounger
son.
16Sheputtheskins oftheyoung goats on
hishands, andonthesmooth ofhisneck.
17She gave the savory food and the
bread, which shehad prepared, into the
hand ofhersonJacob.
18Hecame tohisfather, and said, “My
father? ”
Hesaid, “Here Iam. Who areyou, my
son? ”
19Jacob said tohisfather, “IamEsau
your firstborn. Ihave done what youasked
metodo. Please arise, sitand eatofmy
venison, that your soul may bless me. ”
20Isaac said tohisson, “How isitthatyou
have found itsoquickly, myson? ”
Hesaid, “Because theLORD your God
gave mesuccess. ”
21Isaac said toJacob, “Please come near,
that Imay feelyou, myson, whether you
arereally mysonEsau ornot. ”
22Jacob went near toIsaac hisfather.
Hefelthim, and said, “The voice isJa-
cob ’svoice, butthehands arethehands of
Esau. ”
23Hedidn ’trecognize him, because his
hands were hairy, likehisbrother Esau ’s
hands. Soheblessed him.
24Hesaid, “Areyoureally mysonEsau? ”
Hesaid, “Iam. ”
25Hesaid, “Bring itnear tome,andIwill
eatofmyson ’svenison, that mysoul may
bless you. ”Hebrought itnear tohim, andheate.He
brought him wine, andhedrank.
26Hisfather Isaac said tohim, “Come
near now, andkissme,myson. ”
27Hecame near, and kissed him. He
smelled the smell ofhisclothing, and
blessed him, andsaid,
“Behold, thesmell ofmyson
isasthesmell ofafield which the

28God give youofthedew ofthesky,

29Letpeoples serve you,
andnations bow down toyou.
Belord over your brothers.
Letyour mother ’ssons bow down to
you.
Cursed beeveryone who curses you.
Blessed beeveryone who blesses you. ”
30Assoon asIsaac hadfinished blessing
Jacob, and Jacob had just gone outfrom
thepresence ofIsaac hisfather, Esau his
brother came infrom hishunting.
31He also made savory food, and
brought ittohisfather. Hesaid tohis
father, “Letmyfather arise, and eatofhis
son ’svenison, that your soul may bless
me. ”
32Isaac hisfather said tohim, “Who are
you? ”
Hesaid, “Iamyour son, your firstborn,
Esau. ”
33Isaac trembled violently, and said,
“Who, then, ishewho hastaken venison,
andbrought ittome,andIhave eaten ofall
before you came, and have blessed him?
Yes,hewillbeblessed. ”
34When Esau heard thewords ofhis
father, hecried with anexceedingly great
andbitter cry,andsaid tohisfather, “Bless
me,even mealso, myfather. ”
35Hesaid, “Your brother came with de-
ceit, andhastaken away your blessing. ”
36Hesaid, “Isn’therightly named Jacob?
Forhehassupplanted methese twotimes.
Hetook away mybirthright. See, now
hehastaken away myblessing. ”Hesaid,
“Haven ’tyoureserved ablessing forme? ”
37Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, Ihave
made him your lord, and allhisbrothers
Ihave given tohim forservants. Ihave

sustained him with grain and new wine.
What then willIdoforyou, myson? ”
38Esau said tohisfather, “Doyou have
just one blessing, myfather? Bless me,
even mealso, myfather. ”Esau lifted uphis
voice, andwept.
39Isaac hisfather answered him,
“Behold, your dwelling will beofthefat-
ness oftheearth,
andofthedew oftheskyfrom above.
40Youwilllivebyyour sword, andyouwill
serve your brother.
Itwillhappen, when youwillbreak loose,
that youwillshake hisyoke from offyour
neck. ”
41Esau hated Jacob because ofthebless-
ingwith which hisfather blessed him.
Esau said inhisheart, “Thedays ofmourn-
ingformyfather areathand. Then Iwill
killmybrother Jacob. ”
42Thewords ofEsau, herelder son, were
toldtoRebekah. Shesent andcalled Jacob,
heryounger son, andsaid tohim, “Behold,
your brother Esau comforts himself about
youbyplanning tokillyou.
43Now therefore, myson, obey myvoice.
Arise, fleetoLaban, mybrother, inHaran.
44Stay with him afew days, until your
brother ’sfury turns away —
45until your brother ’sanger turns away
from you, and heforgets what you have
done tohim. Then Iwillsend, andgetyou
from there. Why should Ibebereaved of
youboth inoneday? ”
46Rebekah said toIsaac, “Iamweary of
mylifebecause ofthedaughters ofHeth. If
Jacob takes awife ofthedaughters ofHeth,
such asthese, ofthedaughters oftheland,
what good willmylifedome? ”
28
1Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and
commanded him, “Youshall nottake awife
ofthedaughters ofCanaan.
2Arise, gotoPaddan Aram, tothehouse
ofBethuel your mother ’sfather. Take a
wife from there from thedaughters ofLa-
ban, your mother ’sbrother.
3May God Almighty bless you, andmake
you fruitful, and multiply you, that you
may beacompany ofpeoples,4andgive youtheblessing ofAbraham,
toyouandtoyour offspring with you, that
youmay inherit theland where youtravel,
which God gave toAbraham. ”
5Isaac sent Jacob away. Hewent to
Paddan Aram toLaban, sonofBethuel the
Syrian, thebrother ofRebekah, Jacob ’sand
Esau ’smother.
6Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed
Jacob andsent him away toPaddan Aram,
totake him awife from there, and that as
heblessed him hegave him acommand,
saying, “You shall nottake awife ofthe
daughters ofCanaan; ”
7and that Jacob obeyed hisfather and
hismother, andwasgone toPaddan Aram.
8Esau saw that thedaughters ofCanaan
didn ’tplease Isaac, hisfather.
9SoEsau went toIshmael, and took, in
addition tothewives that hehad, Maha-
lath thedaughter ofIshmael, Abraham ’s
son, thesister ofNebaioth, tobehiswife.
10Jacob went outfrom Beersheba, and
went toward Haran.
11Hecame toacertain place, andstayed
there allnight, because thesun had set.
Hetook oneofthestones oftheplace, and
putitunder hishead, andlaydown inthat
place tosleep.
12Hedreamed and saw astairway set
upon theearth, and itstopreached to
heaven. Behold, theangels ofGod were
ascending anddescending onit.
13Behold, theLORD stood above it,and
said, “IamtheLORD, theGod ofAbraham
your father, and theGod ofIsaac. Iwill
give theland youlieontoyouandtoyour
offspring.
14Your offspring willbeasthedust ofthe
earth, and you will spread abroad tothe
west, andtotheeast, andtothenorth, and
tothesouth. Inyouandinyour offspring,
allthefamilies oftheearth willbeblessed.
15Behold, Iamwith you, and will keep
you, wherever yougo,and willbring you
again intothisland. ForIwillnotleave you
until Ihave done that which Ihave spoken
oftoyou. ”
16Jacob awakened outofhissleep, and
hesaid, “Surely theLORD isinthisplace,
andIdidn ’tknow it.”
--- PAGE 33 ---
Genesis 28:17 29 Genesis 29:25
17Hewas afraid, and said, “How awe-
some thisplace is!This isnone other than
God ’shouse, andthisisthegate ofheaven. ”
18Jacob rose upearly inthemorning,
and took thestone that hehad putunder
hishead, and setitupforapillar, and
poured oilonitstop.
19Hecalled the name ofthat place
Bethel, butthename ofthecitywas Luzat
thefirst.
20Jacob vowed avow, saying, “IfGodwill
bewith me,and will keep meinthisway
thatIgo,andwillgive mebread toeat,and
clothing toputon,
21sothat Icome again tomyfather ’s
house inpeace, and theLORD will bemy
God,
22then thisstone, which Ihave setupfor
apillar, willbeGod ’shouse. Ofallthat you
will give meIwill surely give atenth to
you. ”
29
1Then Jacob went onhisjourney, and
came totheland ofthechildren oftheeast.
2Helooked, and saw awell inthefield,
and saw three flocks ofsheep lying there
byit.Foroutofthat well they watered the
flocks. Thestone onthewell ’smouth was
large.
3There alltheflocks were gathered.
They rolled the stone from the well ’s
mouth, andwatered thesheep, andputthe
stone back onthewell ’smouth initsplace.
4Jacob said tothem, “My relatives,
where areyoufrom? ”
They said, “Wearefrom Haran. ”
5Hesaid tothem, “Doyouknow Laban,
thesonofNahor? ”
They said, “Weknow him. ”
6Hesaid tothem, “Isitwell with him? ”
They said, “Itiswell. See, Rachel, his
daughter, iscoming with thesheep. ”
7Hesaid, “Behold, itisstill themiddle
oftheday, nottime togather thelivestock
together. Water thesheep, andgoandfeed
them. ”
8They said, “Wecan ’t,until alltheflocks
aregathered together, and they roll the
stone from thewell ’smouth. Then wewill
water thesheep. ”9While hewas yetspeaking with them,
Rachel came with herfather ’ssheep, for
shekept them.
10When Jacob saw Rachel thedaughter
ofLaban, hismother ’sbrother, and the
sheep ofLaban, hismother ’sbrother, Ja-
cobwent near, and rolled thestone from
thewell ’smouth, andwatered theflock of
Laban hismother ’sbrother.
11Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted uphis
voice, andwept.
12Jacob told Rachel that hewas herfa-
ther ’srelative, and that hewas Rebekah ’s
son. Sheranandtoldherfather.
13When Laban heard thenews ofJa-
cob, hissister ’sson, herantomeet Jacob,
and embraced him, and kissed him, and
brought himtohishouse. Jacob toldLaban
allthese things.
14Laban said tohim, “Surely youaremy
bone andmyflesh. ”Jacob stayed with him
foramonth.
15Laban said toJacob, “Because youare
myrelative, should youtherefore serve me
fornothing? Tellme,what willyour wages
be?”
16Laban had twodaughters. Thename
oftheelder wasLeah, andthename ofthe
younger wasRachel.
17Leah ’seyes were weak, butRachel was
beautiful inform andattractive.
18Jacob loved Rachel. Hesaid, “Iwill
serve you seven years forRachel, your
younger daughter. ”
19Laban said, “Itisbetter that Igive
hertoyou, than that Ishould give herto
another man. Stay with me. ”
20Jacob served seven years forRachel.
They seemed tohim butafewdays, forthe
love hehadforher.
21Jacob said toLaban, “Give memywife,
formydays arefulfilled, thatImay gointo
her. ”
22Laban gathered together allthemen of
theplace, andmade afeast.
23Inthe evening, hetook Leah his
daughter, and brought hertoJacob. He
went intoher.
24Laban gave Zilpah hisservant tohis
daughter Leah foraservant.
25Inthemorning, behold, itwas Leah!
Hesaid toLaban, “What isthis you have
--- PAGE 34 ---
Genesis 29:26 30 Genesis 30:22
done tome? Didn ’tIserve with you for
Rachel? Why then have youdeceived me? ”
26Laban said, “Itisnotdone soinour
place, togive theyounger before thefirst-
born.
27Fulfill theweek ofthis one, and we
willgive youtheother also fortheservice
which you will serve with meforseven
more years. ”
28Jacob didso,andfulfilled herweek. He
gave him Rachel hisdaughter aswife.
29Laban gave Bilhah, hisservant, tohis
daughter Rachel tobeherservant.
30Hewent inalsotoRachel, andheloved
also Rachel more than Leah, and served
with him seven more years.
31The LORD saw that Leah was hated,
andheopened herwomb, butRachel was
barren.
32Leah conceived, and bore ason, and
shenamed him Reuben. Forshesaid, “Be-
cause theLORD haslooked atmyaffliction;
fornow myhusband willlove me. ”
33Sheconceived again, and bore ason,
and said, “Because theLORD has heard
that Iamhated, hehastherefore given me
thissonalso. ”Shenamed him Simeon.
34Sheconceived again, and bore ason.
Shesaid, “Now thistime myhusband will
bejoined tome, because Ihave borne
him three sons. ”Therefore hisname was
called Levi.
35Sheconceived again, and bore ason.
Shesaid, “This time Iwillpraise theLORD. ”
Therefore shenamed himJudah. Then she
stopped bearing.
30
1When Rachel saw that shebore Jacob
nochildren, Rachel envied hersister. She
said toJacob, “Give mechildren, orelse I
willdie. ”
2Jacob ’sanger burned against Rachel,
andhesaid, “AmIinGod ’splace, who has
withheld from youthefruit ofthewomb? ”
3Shesaid, “Behold, mymaid Bilhah. Go
intoher,that shemay bear onmyknees,
andIalso may obtain children byher. ”
4She gave him Bilhah her servant as
wife, andJacob went intoher.
5Bilhah conceived, andbore Jacob ason.6Rachel said, “God hasjudged me,and
hasalso heard myvoice, andhasgiven me
ason. ”Therefore shecalled hisname Dan.
7Bilhah, Rachel ’sservant, conceived
again, andbore Jacob asecond son.
8Rachel said, “Ihave wrestled with my
sister with mighty wrestlings, and have
prevailed. ”Shenamed him Naphtali.
9When Leah saw that shehad finished
bearing, shetook Zilpah, herservant, and
gave hertoJacob asawife.
10Zilpah, Leah ’sservant, bore Jacob a
son.
11Leah said, “How fortunate! ”She
named him Gad.
12Zilpah, Leah ’sservant, bore Jacob a
second son.
13Leah said, “Happy amI,forthedaugh-
ters will callmehappy. ”Shenamed him
Asher.
14Reuben went inthedays ofwheat
harvest, andfound mandrakes inthefield,
and brought them tohismother, Leah.
Then Rachel said toLeah, “Please give me
some ofyour son ’smandrakes. ”
15Leah said toher, “Isitasmall matter
that you have taken away myhusband?
Would youtake away myson ’smandrakes,
also? ”
Rachel said, “Therefore hewill liewith
youtonight foryour son ’smandrakes. ”
16Jacob came from the field inthe
evening, and Leah went outtomeet him,
and said, “You must come intome; forI
have surely hired youwith myson ’sman-
drakes. ”
Helaywith herthat night.
17God listened toLeah, and she con-
ceived, andbore Jacob afifth son.
18Leah said, “God hasgiven memyhire,
because Igave myservant tomyhusband. ”
Shenamed him Issachar.
19Leah conceived again, andbore asixth
sontoJacob.
20Leah said, “God hasendowed mewith
agood dowry. Now myhusband will live
with me, because Ihave borne him six
sons. ”Shenamed him Zebulun.
21Afterwards, shebore adaughter, and
named herDinah.
22God remembered Rachel, andGod lis-
tened toher,andopened herwomb.

Genesis 30:23 31 Genesis 31:6
23Sheconceived, bore ason, and said,
“God hastaken away myreproach. ”
24Shenamed him Joseph, †saying, “May
theLORD addanother sontome. ”
25When Rachel hadborne Joseph, Jacob
said toLaban, “Send meaway, that Imay
gotomyown place, andtomycountry.
26Give memywives andmychildren for
whom Ihave served you, and letmego;
foryouknow myservice with which Ihave
served you. ”
27Laban said tohim, “Ifnow Ihave
found favor inyour eyes, stay here, forI
have divined thattheLORD hasblessed me
foryour sake. ”
28Hesaid, “Appoint meyour wages, and
Iwillgive it.”
29Jacob said tohim, “You know how I
have served you, and how your livestock
have fared with me.
30Foritwas little which youhadbefore
Icame, and ithasincreased toamulti-
tude. TheLORD hasblessed youwherever
Iturned. Now when willIprovide formy
own house also? ”
31Laban said, “What shall Igive you? ”
Jacob said, “You shall notgive meany-
thing. Ifyouwilldothisthing forme,Iwill
again feed your flock andkeep it.
32Iwillpass through allyour flock today,
removing from there every speckled and
spotted one, and every black one among
thesheep, and thespotted and speckled
among thegoats. This willbemyhire.
33Somyrighteousness will answer for
mehereafter, when youcome concerning
myhire that isbefore you. Every one
that isnotspeckled and spotted among
thegoats, and black among thesheep,
that might bewith me,willbeconsidered
stolen. ”
34Laban said, “Behold, letitbeaccording
toyour word. ”
35That day, heremoved themale goats
that were streaked and spotted, and all
thefemale goats that were speckled and
spotted, every onethathadwhite init,and
alltheblack ones among thesheep, and
gave them into thehand ofhissons.36Hesetthree days ’journey between
himself andJacob, andJacob fedtherestof
Laban ’sflocks.
37Jacob took tohimself rods offresh
poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled
white streaks inthem, andmade thewhite
appear which wasintherods.
38Hesettherods which hehad peeled
opposite theflocks inthewatering troughs
where theflocks came todrink. They con-
ceived when they came todrink.
39Theflocks conceived before therods,
and theflocks produced streaked, speck-
led,andspotted.
40Jacob separated thelambs, andsetthe
faces oftheflocks toward thestreaked and
alltheblack inLaban ’sflock. Heputhis
own droves apart, anddidn ’tputthem into
Laban ’sflock.
41Whenever thestronger oftheflock
conceived, Jacob laid therods infront
oftheeyes oftheflock inthewatering
troughs, that they might conceive among
therods;
42butwhen theflock were feeble, he
didn ’tputthem in. Sothefeebler were
Laban ’s,andthestronger Jacob ’s.
43The man increased exceedingly, and
hadlarge flocks, female servants andmale
servants, andcamels anddonkeys.
31
1Jacob heard Laban ’ssons ’words, say-
ing, “Jacob hastaken away allthat wasour
father ’s.Hehasobtained allthis wealth
from that which wasourfather ’s.”
2Jacob saw theexpression onLaban ’s
face, and, behold, itwasnottoward himas
before.
3TheLORD said toJacob, “Return tothe
land ofyour fathers, andtoyour relatives,
andIwillbewith you. ”
4Jacob sent andcalled Rachel andLeah
tothefield tohisflock,
5andsaid tothem, “Iseetheexpression
onyour father ’sface, that itisnottoward
measbefore; buttheGod ofmyfather has
been with me.
6You know that Ihave served your fa-
ther with allofmystrength.
†30:24 Joseph means “may headd ”.
--- PAGE 36 ---
Genesis 31:7 32 Genesis 31:35
7Your father has deceived me, and
changed mywages ten times, but God
didn ’tallow him tohurt me.
8Ifhesaid, ‘The speckled will beyour
wages, ’then alltheflock bore speckled. If
hesaid, ‘Thestreaked willbeyour wages, ’
then alltheflock bore streaked.
9Thus God hastaken away your father ’s
livestock, andgiven them tome.
10During mating season, Ilifted upmy
eyes, andsaw inadream, andbehold, the
male goats which leaped ontheflock were
streaked, speckled, andgrizzled.
11The angel ofGod said tomeinthe
dream, ‘Jacob, ’andIsaid, ‘Here Iam. ’
12Hesaid, ‘Now liftupyour eyes, andbe-
hold, allthemale goats which leap onthe
flock arestreaked, speckled, andgrizzled,
forIhave seen allthat Laban does toyou.
13IamtheGod ofBethel, where you
anointed apillar, where youvowed avow
tome. Now arise, getoutfrom thisland,
andreturn totheland ofyour birth. ’ ”
14Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is
there yetanyportion orinheritance forus
inourfather ’shouse?
15Aren ’tweconsidered asforeigners by
him? Forhehassold us,andhasalso used
upourmoney.
16Foralltheriches which God hastaken
away from our father areours and our
children ’s.Now then, whatever God has
said toyou, do.”
17Then Jacob rose up,and sethissons
andhiswives onthecamels,
18and hetook away allhislivestock,
andallhispossessions which hehadgath-
ered, including thelivestock which hehad
gained inPaddan Aram, togotoIsaac his
father, totheland ofCanaan.
19Now Laban had gone toshear his
sheep; andRachel stole theteraphim †that
were herfather ’s.
20Jacob deceived Laban theSyrian, in
that hedidn ’ttellhim that hewas running
away.
21Sohefledwith allthat hehad. Herose
up,passed over theRiver, and sethisface
toward themountain ofGilead.22Laban was told onthethird daythat
Jacob hadfled.
23Hetook hisrelatives with him, and
pursued himseven days ’journey. Heover-
took him inthemountain ofGilead.
24God came toLaban theSyrian ina
dream ofthenight, and said tohim, “Be
careful thatyoudon ’tspeak toJacob either
good orbad. ”
25Laban caught upwith Jacob. Now
Jacob hadpitched histentinthemountain,
andLaban with hisrelatives encamped in
themountain ofGilead.
26Laban said toJacob, “What have you
done, that youhave deceived me,andcar-
ried away mydaughters like captives of
thesword?
27Why didyoufleesecretly, anddeceive
me, and didn ’ttellme, that Imight have
sent youaway with mirth andwith songs,
with tambourine andwith harp;
28and didn ’tallow metokiss mysons
and mydaughters? Now you have done
foolishly.
29Itisinthepower ofmyhand tohurt
you, buttheGodofyour father spoke tome
lastnight, saying, ‘Becareful thatyoudon ’t
speak toJacob either good orbad. ’
30Now, youwant tobegone, because you
greatly longed foryour father ’shouse, but
why have youstolen mygods? ”
31Jacob answered Laban, “Because Iwas
afraid, forIsaid, ‘Lest youshould take your
daughters from mebyforce. ’
32Anyone youfind your gods with shall
notlive. Before ourrelatives, discern what
isyours with me, and take it.”ForJacob
didn ’tknow that Rachel hadstolen them.
33Laban went into Jacob ’stent, into
Leah ’stent, and into thetent ofthetwo
female servants; buthedidn ’tfind them.
Hewent outofLeah ’stent, and entered
into Rachel ’stent.
34Now Rachel had taken theteraphim,
putthem inthecamel ’ssaddle, andsaton
them. Laban feltaround allthetent, but
didn ’tfind them.
35She said toherfather, “Don ’tletmy
lord beangry that Ican ’trise upbe-

fore you; forI’mhaving myperiod. ”He
searched, butdidn ’tfind theteraphim.
36Jacob was angry, andargued with La-
ban. Jacob answered Laban, “What ismy
trespass? What ismysin,that you have
hotly pursued me?
37Now that you have feltaround inall
mystuff, what have youfound ofallyour
household stuff? Setithere before my
relatives andyour relatives, that they may
judge between ustwo.
38“These twenty years Ihave been with
you. Your ewes and your female goats
have notcast their young, and Ihaven ’t
eaten therams ofyour flocks.
39That which was torn ofanimals, I
didn ’tbring toyou. Ibore itsloss. Ofmy
hand you required it,whether stolen by
dayorstolen bynight.
40This was mysituation: inthedaythe
drought consumed me, and thefrost by
night; andmysleep fledfrom myeyes.
41These twenty years Ihave been inyour
house. Iserved you fourteen years for
your twodaughters, andsixyears foryour
flock, andyouhave changed mywages ten
times.
42Unless theGod ofmyfather, theGod
ofAbraham, and thefear ofIsaac, had
been with me,surely now youwould have
sent meaway empty. God hasseen my
affliction and thelabor ofmyhands, and
rebuked youlastnight. ”
43Laban answered Jacob, “The daugh-
tersaremydaughters, thechildren aremy
children, theflocks aremyflocks, and all
that youseeismine! What canIdotoday
tothese mydaughters, ortotheir children
whom they have borne?
44Now come, let’smake acovenant, you
and I.Letitbeforawitness between me
andyou. ”
45Jacob took astone, and setitupfora
pillar.
46Jacob said tohisrelatives, “Gather
stones. ”They took stones, and made a
heap. They atethere bytheheap.47Laban called itJegar Sahadutha, ‡but
Jacob called itGaleed. §
48Laban said, “This heap iswitness be-
tween meandyoutoday. ”Therefore itwas
named Galeed
49and Mizpah, forhesaid, “The LORD
watch between meandyou, when weare
absent onefrom another.
50Ifyou afflict mydaughters, orifyou
take wives inaddition tomydaughters,
noman iswith us;behold, God iswitness
between meandyou. ”
51Laban said toJacob, “Seethis heap,
and seethepillar, which Ihave setbe-
tween meandyou.
52May this heap beawitness, and the
pillar beawitness, that Iwillnotpass over
thisheap toyou, andthat youwillnotpass
over this heap and this pillar tome, for
harm.
53The God ofAbraham, and theGod
ofNahor, theGod oftheir father, judge
between us.”Then Jacob swore bythefear
ofhisfather, Isaac.
54Jacob offered asacrifice inthemoun-
tain, and called hisrelatives toeatbread.
They atebread, andstayed allnight inthe
mountain.
55Early inthemorning, Laban rose up,
andkissed hissons andhisdaughters, and
blessed them. Laban departed and re-
turned tohisplace.
32
1Jacob went onhisway, and theangels
ofGod methim.
2When hesaw them, Jacob said, “This is
God ’sarmy. ”Hecalled thename ofthat
place Mahanaim. †
3Jacob sent messengers infront ofhim
toEsau, hisbrother, totheland ofSeir, the
field ofEdom.
4Hecommanded them, saying, “This is
what youshall tellmylord, Esau: ‘This is
what your servant, Jacob, says. Ihave lived
asaforeigner with Laban, andstayed until
now.
5Ihave cattle, donkeys, flocks, male ser-
vants, andfemale servants. Ihave sent to

tellmylord, that Imay find favor inyour
sight. ’ ”
6Themessengers returned toJacob, say-
ing, “Wecame toyour brother Esau. He
iscoming tomeet you, and four hundred
men arewith him. ”
7Then Jacob was greatly afraid andwas
distressed. Hedivided thepeople who
were with him, along with theflocks, the
herds, andthecamels, intotwocompanies.
8Hesaid, “IfEsau comes totheone
company, andstrikes it,then thecompany
which isleftwillescape. ”
9Jacob said, “Godofmyfather Abraham,
andGodofmyfather Isaac, theLORD, who
said tome, ‘Return toyour country, andto
your relatives, andIwilldoyougood, ’
10Iamnotworthy oftheleast ofall
theloving kindnesses, andofallthetruth,
which you have shown toyour servant;
forwith just mystaff Icrossed over this
Jordan; and now Ihave become twocom-
panies.
11Please deliver mefrom thehand ofmy
brother, from thehand ofEsau; forIfear
him, lesthecome and strike meand the
mothers with thechildren.
12Yousaid, ‘Iwillsurely doyougood, and
make your offspring asthesand ofthesea,
which can ’tbecounted because there are
somany. ’ ”
13Hestayed there that night, and took
from thatwhich hehadwith himapresent
forEsau, hisbrother:
14twohundred female goats andtwenty
male goats, twohundred ewes andtwenty
rams,
15thirty milk camels and their colts,
forty cows, tenbulls, twenty female don-
keys andtenfoals.
16Hedelivered them into thehands of
hisservants, every herd byitself, andsaid
tohisservants, “Pass over before me,and
putaspace between herd andherd. ”
17Hecommanded theforemost, saying,
“When Esau, mybrother, meets you, and
asks you, saying, ‘Whose areyou? Where
areyou going? Whose arethese before
you? ’
18Then you shall say, ‘They areyourservant, Jacob ’s.Itisapresent sent tomy
lord, Esau. Behold, healso isbehind us.’ ”
19Hecommanded also thesecond, and
thethird, and allthat followed theherds,
saying, “This ishow you shall speak to
Esau, when youfind him.
20You shall say, ‘Notonly that, butbe-
hold, your servant, Jacob, isbehind us.’ ”
For,hesaid, “Iwill appease him with the
present that goes before me, and after-
ward Iwill seehisface. Perhaps hewill
accept me. ”
21Sothepresent passed over before him,
and hehimself stayed that night inthe
camp.
22Herose upthat night, and took his
two wives, and histwo servants, and his
eleven sons, and crossed over theford of
theJabbok.
23Hetook them, andsent them over the
stream, andsent over that which hehad.
24Jacob was left alone, and wrestled
with aman there until thebreaking ofthe
day.
25When hesaw that hedidn ’tprevail
against him, theman touched thehollow
ofhisthigh, andthehollow ofJacob ’sthigh
wasstrained ashewrestled.
26Theman said, “Letmego,fortheday
breaks. ”
Jacob said, “Iwon ’tletyougounless you
bless me. ”
27Hesaid tohim, “What isyour name? ”
Hesaid, “Jacob ”.
28Hesaid, “Your name will nolonger
becalled Jacob, butIsrael; foryou have
fought with God and with men, and have
prevailed. ”
29Jacob asked him, “Please tellmeyour
name. ”
Hesaid, “Why isitthat youaskwhat my
name is?”Soheblessed him there.
30Jacob called thename oftheplace
Peniel; ‡forhesaid, “Ihave seen God face
toface, andmylifeispreserved. ”
31Thesunrose onhim ashepassed over
Peniel, andhelimped because ofhisthigh.
32Therefore thechildren ofIsrael don ’t
eatthesinew ofthehip, which isonthe

touched thehollow ofJacob ’sthigh inthe
sinew ofthehip.

1Jacob lifted uphiseyes, and looked,
and, behold, Esau was coming, and with
him four hundred men. Hedivided the
children between Leah, Rachel, and the
twoservants.
2Heputtheservants andtheir children
infront, Leah and herchildren after, and
Rachel andJoseph attherear.
3Hehimself passed over infront of
them, and bowed himself totheground
seven times, until hecame near tohis
brother.
4Esau rantomeet him, embraced him,
fellonhisneck, kissed him, andthey wept.
5Helifted uphiseyes, and saw the
women and thechildren; and said, “Who
arethese with you? ”
Hesaid, “The children whom God has
graciously given your servant. ”
6Then theservants came near with their
children, andthey bowed themselves.
7Leah also andherchildren came near,
andbowed themselves. After them, Joseph
came near with Rachel, and they bowed
themselves.
8Esau said, “What doyou mean byall
thiscompany which Imet? ”
Jacob said, “Tofind favor inthesight of
mylord. ”
9Esau said, “Ihave enough, mybrother;
letthat which youhave beyours. ”
10Jacob said, “Please, no,ifIhave now
found favor inyour sight, then receive my
present atmyhand, because Ihave seen
your face, asonesees theface ofGod, and
youwere pleased with me.
11Please take thegiftthat Ibrought to
you, because Godhasdealt graciously with
me,andbecause Ihave enough. ”Heurged
him, andhetook it.
12Esau said, “Let’stake ourjourney, and
let’sgo,andIwillgobefore you. ”
13Jacob said tohim, “Mylord knows that
thechildren aretender, andthat theflocks
andherds with mehave their young, andifthey overdrive them oneday, alltheflocks
willdie.
14Please letmylord pass over before his
servant, and Iwill lead ongently, accord-
ingtothepace ofthelivestock that are
before meandaccording tothepace ofthe
children, until Icome tomylord toSeir. ”
15Esau said, “Letmenow leave with you
some ofthepeople who arewith me. ”
Hesaid, “Why? Letmefind favor inthe
sight ofmylord. ”
16SoEsau returned that dayonhisway
toSeir.
17Jacob traveled toSuccoth, built him-
self ahouse, and made shelters forhis
livestock. Therefore thename oftheplace
iscalled Succoth. †
18Jacob came inpeace tothecity of
Shechem, which isintheland ofCanaan,
when hecame from Paddan Aram; and
encamped before thecity.
19Hebought theparcel ofground where
hehad spread histent, atthehand ofthe
children ofHamor, Shechem ’sfather, for
onehundred pieces ofmoney.
20Heerected analtar there, andcalled it
ElElohe Israel. ‡
34
1Dinah, thedaughter ofLeah, whom she
bore toJacob, went outtoseethedaugh-
tersoftheland.
2Shechem thesonofHamor theHivite,
theprince oftheland, saw her. Hetook
her,laywith her,andhumbled her.
3Hissoul joined toDinah, thedaughter
ofJacob, andheloved theyoung lady, and
spoke kindly totheyoung lady.
4Shechem spoke tohisfather, Hamor,
saying, “Getmethisyoung lady asawife. ”
5Now Jacob heard that hehad defiled
Dinah, hisdaughter; and hissons were
with hislivestock inthefield. Jacob held
hispeace until they came.
6Hamor thefather ofShechem went out
toJacob totalkwith him.
7Thesons ofJacob came infrom thefield
when they heard it.Themen were grieved,
andthey were very angry, because hehad
†33:17 succoth means shelters orbooths. ‡33:20 ElElohe Israel means “God, theGod ofIsrael ”or“TheGod of

--- PAGE 40 ---
Genesis 34:8 36 Genesis 35:2
done folly inIsrael inlying with Jacob ’s
daughter, athing thatought nottobedone.
8Hamor talked with them, saying, “The
soul ofmyson, Shechem, longs foryour
daughter. Please give hertohim asawife.
9Make marriages with us. Give your
daughters tous,andtake ourdaughters for
yourselves.
10Youshall dwell with us,and theland
willbebefore you. Live andtrade init,and
getpossessions init.”
11Shechem said toherfather andtoher
brothers, “Letmefind favor inyour eyes,
andwhatever youwilltellmeIwillgive.
12Ask meagreat amount foradowry,
andIwillgive whatever youaskofme,but
give metheyoung lady asawife. ”
13Thesons ofJacob answered Shechem
and Hamor hisfather with deceit when
they spoke, because hehad defiled Dinah
their sister,
14and said tothem, “Wecan ’tdothis
thing, togive oursister toonewho isun-
circumcised; forthat isareproach tous.
15Only onthiscondition willweconsent
toyou. Ifyouwillbeasweare,that every
male ofyoubecircumcised,
16then will wegive our daughters to
you; andwewilltake your daughters tous,
and wewill dwell with you, and wewill
become onepeople.
17Butifyouwill notlisten tousand be
circumcised, then wewilltake oursister, †
andwewillbegone. ”
18Their words pleased Hamor and
Shechem, Hamor ’sson.
19Theyoung man didn ’twait todothis
thing, because hehad delight inJacob ’s
daughter, and hewas honored above all
thehouse ofhisfather.
20Hamor andShechem, hisson, came to
thegate oftheir city, and talked with the
men oftheir city, saying,
21“These men are peaceful with us.
Therefore letthem live intheland and
trade init.Forbehold, theland islarge
enough forthem. Let’stake their daugh-
terstousforwives, andlet’sgive them our
daughters.22Only onthis condition will themen
consent toustolivewith us,tobecome one
people, ifevery male among usiscircum-
cised, asthey arecircumcised.
23Won ’ttheir livestock andtheir posses-
sions and alltheir animals beours? Only
let’sgive ourconsent tothem, andthey will
dwell with us.”
24Allwho went outofthegate ofhiscity
listened toHamor, andtoShechem hisson;
and every male was circumcised, allwho
went outofthegate ofhiscity.
25Onthethird day,when they were sore,
two ofJacob ’ssons, Simeon and Levi, Di-
nah ’sbrothers, each took hissword, came
upon theunsuspecting city, and killed all
themales.
26They killed Hamor and Shechem, his
son, with theedge ofthesword, and took
Dinah outofShechem ’shouse, and went
away.
27Jacob ’ssons came onthedead, and
plundered thecity, because they had de-
filed their sister.
28They took their flocks, their herds,
their donkeys, that which was inthecity,
that which wasinthefield,
29andalltheir wealth. They took captive
alltheir little ones and their wives, and
took asplunder everything that wasinthe
house.
30Jacob said toSimeon and Levi, “You
have troubled me, tomake meodious to
theinhabitants oftheland, among the
Canaanites and thePerizzites. Iamfew
innumber. They will gather themselves
together against meand strike me, and I
willbedestroyed, Iandmyhouse. ”
31They said, “Should hedeal with our
sister aswith aprostitute? ”
35
1God said toJacob, “Arise, goupto
Bethel, andlivethere. Make there analtar
toGod, who appeared toyouwhen youfled
from theface ofEsau your brother. ”
2Then Jacob said tohishousehold, and
toallwho were with him, “Putaway the
foreign gods that areamong you, purify
yourselves, andchange your garments.
†34:17 Hebrew has, literally, “daughter ”
--- PAGE 41 ---
Genesis 35:3 37 Genesis 36:6
3Let’sarise, and gouptoBethel. Iwill
make there analtar toGod, who answered
meinthedayofmydistress, andwaswith
meontheway which Iwent. ”
4They gave toJacob allthe foreign
gods which were intheir hands, and the
rings which were intheir ears; and Jacob
hid them under theoak which was by
Shechem.
5They traveled, andaterror ofGod was
onthecities that were around them, and
they didn ’tpursue thesons ofJacob.
6SoJacob came toLuz (that is,Bethel),
which isintheland ofCanaan, heand all
thepeople who were with him.
7Hebuilt analtar there, and called the
place ElBeth El;because there God was
revealed tohim, when hefled from the
face ofhisbrother.
8Deborah, Rebekah ’snurse, died, and
shewas buried below Bethel under the
oak; anditsname wascalled Allon Bacuth.
9God appeared toJacob again, when he
came from Paddan Aram, andblessed him.
10God said tohim, “Your name isJacob.
Your name shall notbeJacob anymore, but
your name willbeIsrael. ”Henamed him
Israel.
11God said tohim, “IamGod Almighty.
Befruitful and multiply. Anation and a
company ofnations willbefrom you, and
kings willcome outofyour body.
12The land which Igave toAbraham
andIsaac, Iwillgive ittoyou, andtoyour
offspring after youIwillgive theland. ”
13God went upfrom him intheplace
where hespoke with him.
14Jacob setupapillar intheplace where
hespoke with him, apillar ofstone. He
poured out adrink offering onit,and
poured oilonit.
15Jacob called thename oftheplace
where God spoke with him “Bethel ”.
16They traveled from Bethel. There was
stillsome distance tocome toEphrath, and
Rachel travailed. Shehadhard labor.
17When shewas inhard labor, themid-
wife said toher, “Don ’tbeafraid, fornow
youwillhave another son. ”18Asher soul was departing (for she
died), shenamed him Benoni, †buthisfa-
ther named him Benjamin. ‡
19Rachel died, and was buried onthe
way toEphrath (also called Bethlehem).
20Jacob setupapillar onhergrave. The
same isthePillar ofRachel ’sgrave tothis
day.
21Israel traveled, and spread histent
beyond thetower ofEder.
22While Israel lived inthatland, Reuben
went andlaywith Bilhah, hisfather ’scon-
cubine, andIsrael heard ofit.
Now thesons ofJacob were twelve.
23The sons ofLeah: Reuben (Jacob ’s
firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar,
andZebulun.
24The sons ofRachel: Joseph and Ben-
jamin.

27Jacob came toIsaac hisfather, to
Mamre, toKiriath Arba (which isHebron),
where Abraham andIsaac lived asforeign-
ers.
28The days ofIsaac were one hundred
eighty years.
29Isaac gave upthespirit anddied, and
was gathered tohispeople, oldandfullof
days. Esau andJacob, hissons, buried him.

1Jacob lived intheland ofhisfather ’s
travels, intheland ofCanaan.
2This isthehistory ofthegenerations of
Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old,
was feeding theflock with hisbrothers.
Hewas aboywith thesons ofBilhah and
Zilpah, hisfather ’swives. Joseph brought
anevilreport ofthem totheir father.
3Now Israel loved Joseph more than all
hischildren, because hewas thesonofhis
oldage, andhemade him atunic ofmany
colors.
4Hisbrothers sawthattheir father loved
him more than allhisbrothers, and they
hated him, and couldn ’tspeak peaceably
tohim.
5Joseph dreamed adream, andhetoldit
tohisbrothers, andthey hated him allthe
more.
6Hesaid tothem, “Please hear this
dream which Ihave dreamed:
7forbehold, wewere binding sheaves
inthefield, and behold, mysheaf arose
and also stood upright; and behold, your
sheaves came around, andbowed down to
mysheaf. ”
8Hisbrothers asked him, “Will you in-
deed reign over us?Will youindeed have
dominion over us?”They hated himallthe
more forhisdreams andforhiswords.
9Hedreamed yetanother dream, and
told ittohisbrothers, and said, “Behold,
Ihave dreamed yetanother dream: and
behold, thesunand themoon and eleven
stars bowed down tome. ”
10Hetold ittohisfather and tohis
brothers. Hisfather rebuked him, and
said tohim, “What isthisdream that you
have dreamed? Will Iand your mother
and your brothers indeed come tobow
ourselves down totheearth before you? ”11Hisbrothers envied him, buthisfather
kept thissaying inmind.
12Hisbrothers went tofeed their father ’s
flock inShechem.
13Israel said toJoseph, “Aren ’tyour
brothers feeding theflock inShechem?
Come, andIwillsend youtothem. ”Hesaid
tohim, “Here Iam. ”
14Hesaid tohim, “Gonow, seewhether
itiswell with your brothers, andwell with
theflock; andbring meword again. ”Sohe
sent him outofthevalley ofHebron, and
hecame toShechem.
15Acertain man found him, andbehold,
hewas wandering inthefield. The man
asked him, “What areyoulooking for? ”
16Hesaid, “Iamlooking formybrothers.
Tellme,please, where they arefeeding the
flock. ”
17Theman said, “They have lefthere, for
Iheard them say, ‘Let’sgotoDothan. ’ ”
Joseph went after hisbrothers, and
found them inDothan.
18They saw him afar off,and before he
came near tothem, they conspired against
him tokillhim.
19They said tooneanother, “Behold, this
dreamer comes.
20Come now therefore, andlet’skillhim,
and cast him into one ofthepits, and
wewillsay, ‘Anevilanimal hasdevoured
him. ’Wewillseewhat willbecome ofhis
dreams. ”
21Reuben heard it,and delivered him
outoftheir hand, andsaid, “Let’snottake
hislife. ”
22Reuben said tothem, “Shed noblood.
Throw him into this pitthat isinthe
wilderness, butlaynohand onhim ”—that
hemight deliver him outoftheir hand, to
restore him tohisfather.
23When Joseph came tohisbrothers,
they stripped Joseph ofhistunic, thetunic
ofmany colors that wasonhim;
24andthey took him, andthrew himinto
thepit.Thepitwas empty. There was no
water init.
25They satdown toeatbread, and they
lifted uptheir eyes and looked, and saw
acaravan ofIshmaelites coming from
Gilead, with their camels bearing spices
and balm and myrrh, going tocarry it
down toEgypt.
--- PAGE 44 ---
Genesis 37:26 40 Genesis 38:17
26Judah said tohisbrothers, “What
profit isitifwekillourbrother andconceal
hisblood?
27Come, and let’ssellhim totheIsh-
maelites, and notletourhand beonhim;
forheisourbrother, ourflesh. ”Hisbroth-
erslistened tohim.
28Midianites who were merchants
passed by,and they drew and lifted up
Joseph outofthepit,and sold Joseph to
theIshmaelites fortwenty pieces ofsilver.
Themerchants brought Joseph into Egypt.
29Reuben returned tothepit,and saw
that Joseph wasn ’tinthepit;and hetore
hisclothes.
30Hereturned tohisbrothers, andsaid,
“Thechild isnomore; and I,where will I
go?”
31They took Joseph ’stunic, and killed
amale goat, and dipped thetunic inthe
blood.
32They took thetunic ofmany colors,
and they brought ittotheir father, and
said, “Wehave found this. Examine it,
now, andseeifitisyour son ’stunic ornot. ”
33Herecognized it,and said, “Itismy
son ’stunic. Anevilanimal hasdevoured
him. Joseph iswithout doubt torn in
pieces. ”
34Jacob tore hisclothes, and putsack-
cloth onhiswaist, andmourned forhisson
many days.
35Allhissons andallhisdaughters rose
uptocomfort him, butherefused tobe
comforted. Hesaid, “ForIwillgodown to
Sheol †tomyson, mourning. ”Hisfather
wept forhim.
36The Midianites sold him into Egypt
toPotiphar, anofficer ofPharaoh ’s,the
captain oftheguard.
38
1Atthattime, Judah went down from his
brothers, andvisited acertain Adullamite,
whose name wasHirah.
2There, Judah saw thedaughter ofa
certain Canaanite man named Shua. He
took her,andwent intoher.
3Sheconceived, andbore ason; andhe
named him Er.
4Sheconceived again, and bore ason;
andshenamed him Onan.5Sheyetagain bore ason, and named
him Shelah. Hewas atChezib when she
bore him.
6Judah took awife forEr,hisfirstborn,
andhername wasTamar.
7Er,Judah ’sfirstborn, was wicked inthe
LORD ’ssight. SotheLORD killed him.
8Judah said toOnan, “Gointoyour
brother ’swife, and perform theduty of
ahusband ’sbrother toher, and raise up
offspring foryour brother. ”
9Onan knew that theoffspring wouldn ’t
behis; and when hewent intohis
brother ’swife, hespilled hissemen onthe
ground, lestheshould give offspring tohis
brother.
10Thething which hedidwas evilinthe
LORD ’ssight, andhekilled him also.
11Then Judah said toTamar, his
daughter-in-law, “Remain awidow inyour
father ’shouse, until Shelah, myson, is
grown up;”forhesaid, “Lest healso die,
likehisbrothers. ”Tamar went and lived
inherfather ’shouse.
12After many days, Shua ’sdaughter, the
wife ofJudah, died. Judah was comforted,
andwent uptohissheep shearers toTim-
nah, heand hisfriend Hirah, theAdul-
lamite.
13Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-
in-law isgoing uptoTimnah toshear his
sheep. ”
14Shetook offthegarments ofherwid-
owhood, andcovered herself with herveil,
andwrapped herself, andsatinthegate of
Enaim, which isontheway toTimnah; for
shesawthatShelah wasgrown up,andshe
wasn ’tgiven tohim asawife.
15When Judah saw her,hethought that
shewas aprostitute, forshehad covered
herface.
16Heturned toherbytheway, andsaid,
“Please come, letmecome intoyou, ”for
hedidn ’tknow that shewas hisdaughter-
in-law.
Shesaid, “What will you give me, that
youmay come intome? ”
17Hesaid, “Iwillsend youayoung goat

She said, “Will you give meapledge,

Hegave them toher,andcame intoher,

20Judah sent theyoung goat bythehand

21Then heasked themen ofherplace,

24About three months later, Judah was
told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has
played theprostitute. Moreover, behold,
sheiswith child byprostitution. ”
Judah said, “Bring herout,andletherbe
burned. ”
25When shewasbrought out,shesent to
herfather-in-law, saying, “Iamwith child
bytheman who owns these. ”She also
said, “Please discern whose these are—the
signet, andthecords, andthestaff. ”
26Judah acknowledged them, and said,
“She ismore righteous than I,because I
didn ’tgive hertoShelah, myson. ”
Heknew heragain nomore.
27Inthetime ofhertravail, behold, twins
were inherwomb.
28When she travailed, one put outa
hand, and themidwife took and tied a
scarlet thread onhishand, saying, “This
came outfirst. ”
29Ashedrew back hishand, behold, his
brother came out,andshesaid, “Why have
you made abreach foryourself? ”There-
fore hisname wascalled Perez. †30Afterward hisbrother came out, who
hadthescarlet thread onhishand, andhis
name wascalled Zerah. ‡

1Joseph was brought down toEgypt.
Potiphar, anofficer ofPharaoh ’s,thecap-
tain oftheguard, anEgyptian, bought him
from thehand oftheIshmaelites that had
brought him down there.
2TheLORD waswith Joseph, andhewas
aprosperous man. Hewas inthehouse of
hismaster theEgyptian.
3Hismaster sawthattheLORD waswith
him, and that theLORD made allthat he
didprosper inhishand.
4Joseph found favor inhissight. He
ministered tohim, andPotiphar made him
overseer over hishouse, and allthat he
hadheputinto hishand.
5From thetime that hemade him over-
seer inhishouse, andover allthat hehad,
theLORD blessed theEgyptian ’shouse for
Joseph ’ssake. TheLORD ’sblessing was on
allthathehad, inthehouse andinthefield.
6Heleftallthat hehadinJoseph ’shand.
Hedidn ’tconcern himself with anything,
except forthefood which heate.
Joseph waswell-built andhandsome.
7After these things, hismaster ’swife set
hereyes onJoseph; andshesaid, “Liewith
me. ”
8Butherefused, andsaid tohismaster ’s
wife, “Behold, mymaster doesn ’tknow
what iswith meinthehouse, and hehas
putallthat hehasinto myhand.
9Noone isgreater inthis house than
Iam, and hehasnotkept back anything
from mebutyou, because youarehiswife.
How then canIdothisgreat wickedness,
andsinagainst God? ”
10Asshespoke toJoseph daybyday, he
didn ’tlisten toher, toliebyher, ortobe
with her.
11About thistime, hewent intothehouse
todohiswork, andthere were none ofthe
men ofthehouse inside.
12Shecaught himbyhisgarment, saying,
“Liewith me! ”
Helefthisgarment inherhand, andran
outside.
†38:29 Perez means “breaking out”.‡38:30 Zerah means “scarlet ”or“brightness ”.

Genesis 39:13 42 Genesis 40:19
13When she saw that hehad lefthis
garment inherhand, andhadrunoutside,
14shecalled tothemen ofherhouse,
andspoke tothem, saying, “Behold, hehas
brought aHebrew intoustomock us.He
came intometoliewith me,and Icried
with aloud voice.
15When heheard that Ilifted upmy
voice andcried, helefthisgarment byme,
andranoutside. ”
16Shelaid uphisgarment byher, until
hismaster came home.
17She spoke tohim according tothese
words, saying, “The Hebrew servant,
whom youhave brought tous,came into
metomock me,
18and asIlifted upmyvoice and cried,
helefthisgarment byme, and ranout-
side. ”
19When hismaster heard thewords of
hiswife, which shespoke tohim, saying,
“This iswhat your servant didtome, ”his
wrath waskindled.
20Joseph ’smaster took him, andputhim
into theprison, theplace where theking ’s
prisoners were bound, andhewasthere in
custody.
21ButtheLORD was with Joseph, and
showed kindness tohim, andgave him fa-
vorinthesight ofthekeeper oftheprison.
22Thekeeper oftheprison committed to
Joseph ’shand alltheprisoners who were
intheprison. Whatever they didthere, he
wasresponsible forit.
23The keeper oftheprison didn ’tlook
after anything that was under hishand,
because theLORD was with him; andthat
which hedid,theLORD made itprosper.
40
1After these things, thebutler oftheking
ofEgypt andhisbaker offended their lord,
theking ofEgypt.
2Pharaoh was angry with histwo offi-
cers, thechief cup bearer and thechief
baker.
3Heputthem incustody inthehouse of
thecaptain oftheguard, into theprison,
theplace where Joseph wasbound.
4Thecaptain oftheguard assigned them
toJoseph, andhetook care ofthem. They
stayed inprison many days.5They both dreamed adream, each man
hisdream, inonenight, each man accord-
ingtotheinterpretation ofhisdream, the
cup bearer and thebaker oftheking of
Egypt, who were bound intheprison.
6Joseph came intothem inthemorning,
andsawthem, andsawthatthey were sad.
7Heasked Pharaoh ’sofficers who were
with him incustody inhismaster ’shouse,
saying, “Why doyoulook sosadtoday? ”
8They said tohim, “Wehave dreamed
adream, and there isnoone who can
interpret it.”
Joseph said tothem, “Don ’tinterpreta-
tions belong toGod? Please tellittome. ”
9The chief cup bearer told hisdream
toJoseph, and said tohim, “Inmydream,
behold, avine wasinfront ofme,
10andinthevine were three branches. It
wasasthough itbudded, itblossomed, and
itsclusters produced ripe grapes.
11Pharaoh ’scup was inmyhand; and
Itook thegrapes, and pressed them into
Pharaoh ’scup, and Igave thecup into
Pharaoh ’shand. ”
12Joseph said tohim, “This isitsinterpre-
tation: thethree branches arethree days.
13Within three more days, Pharaoh will
liftupyour head, and restore youtoyour
office. Youwillgive Pharaoh ’scupinto his
hand, theway youdidwhen youwere his
cupbearer.
14Butremember mewhen itiswell with
you. Please show kindness tome, and
make mention ofmetoPharaoh, andbring
meoutofthishouse.
15Forindeed, Iwas stolen away outof
theland oftheHebrews, and here also I
have done nothing thatthey should putme
into thedungeon. ”
16When thechief baker saw that the
interpretation wasgood, hesaid toJoseph,
“Ialsowasinmydream, andbehold, three
baskets ofwhite bread were onmyhead.
17Intheuppermost basket there were
allkinds ofbaked food forPharaoh, and
thebirds atethem outofthebasket onmy
head. ”
18Joseph answered, “This isitsinterpre-
tation. Thethree baskets arethree days.
19Within three more days, Pharaoh will
liftupyour head from offyou, and will
--- PAGE 47 ---
Genesis 40:20 43 Genesis 41:24
hang youonatree; and thebirds willeat
your flesh from offyou. ”
20Onthethird day,which wasPharaoh ’s
birthday, hemade afeast forallhisser-
vants, andhelifted upthehead ofthechief
cupbearer andthehead ofthechief baker
among hisservants.
21Herestored thechief cupbearer tohis
position again, and hegave thecup into
Pharaoh ’shand;
22but hehanged the chief baker, as
Joseph hadinterpreted tothem.
23Yetthechief cupbearer didn ’tremem-
berJoseph, butforgot him.
41
1Attheend oftwo fullyears, Pharaoh
dreamed, and behold, hestood bythe
river.
2Behold, seven cattle came upoutofthe
river. They were sleek and fat,and they
fedinthemarsh grass.
3Behold, seven other cattle came upaf-
terthem outoftheriver, ugly andthin, and
stood bytheother cattle onthebrink ofthe
river.
4The ugly and thin cattle ateupthe
seven sleek and fatcattle. SoPharaoh
awoke.
5Heslept and dreamed asecond time;
andbehold, seven heads ofgrain came up
ononestalk, healthy andgood.
6Behold, seven heads ofgrain, thin and
blasted with theeastwind, sprung upafter
them.
7The thin heads ofgrain swallowed up
theseven healthy and fullears. Pharaoh
awoke, andbehold, itwasadream.
8Inthemorning, hisspirit wastroubled,
and hesent and called forallofEgypt ’s
magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told
them hisdreams, butthere was noone
who could interpret them toPharaoh.
9Then thechief cup bearer spoke to
Pharaoh, saying, “Iremember myfaults
today.
10Pharaoh was angry with hisservants,
and putmeincustody inthehouse ofthe
captain oftheguard, with thechief baker.11Wedreamed adream inonenight, he
andI.Each man dreamed according tothe
interpretation ofhisdream.
12There waswith usthere ayoung man,
aHebrew, servant tothecaptain ofthe
guard, andwetoldhim, andheinterpreted
tousourdreams. Heinterpreted toeach
man according tohisdream.
13Asheinterpreted tous,soitwas. He
restored metomyoffice, and hehanged
him. ”
14Then Pharaoh sent andcalled Joseph,
and they brought him hastily outofthe
dungeon. Heshaved himself, changed his
clothing, andcame intoPharaoh.
15Pharaoh said toJoseph, “Ihave
dreamed adream, andthere isnoonewho
can interpret it.Ihave heard itsaid of
you, that when youhear adream youcan
interpret it.”
16Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It
isn’tinme. God will give Pharaoh an
answer ofpeace. ”
17Pharaoh spoke toJoseph, “Inmy
dream, behold, Istood onthebrink ofthe
river;
18andbehold, seven fatandsleek cattle
came upoutoftheriver. They fedinthe
marsh grass;
19and behold, seven other cattle came
upafter them, poor andvery ugly andthin,
such asInever sawinalltheland ofEgypt
forugliness.
20Thethin andugly cattle ateupthefirst
seven fatcattle;
21and when they had eaten them up,
itcouldn ’tbeknown that they had eaten
them, butthey were still ugly, asatthe
beginning. SoIawoke.
22Isaw inmydream, andbehold, seven
heads ofgrain came upononestalk, full
andgood;
23and behold, seven heads ofgrain,
withered, thin, and blasted with theeast
wind, sprung upafter them.
24Thethin heads ofgrain swallowed up
theseven good heads ofgrain. Itold itto
themagicians, butthere was noonewho
could explain ittome. ”
--- PAGE 48 ---
Genesis 41:25 44 Genesis 41:53
25Joseph said toPharaoh, “Thedream of
Pharaoh isone. What Godisabout todohe
hasdeclared toPharaoh.
26Theseven good cattle areseven years;
and theseven good heads ofgrain are
seven years. Thedream isone.
27The seven thin and ugly cattle that
came upafter them are seven years,
and also theseven empty heads ofgrain
blasted with theeast wind; they will be
seven years offamine.
28That isthething which Ihave spoken
toPharaoh. God hasshown Pharaoh what
heisabout todo.
29Behold, seven years ofgreat plenty
throughout alltheland ofEgypt arecom-
ing.
30Seven years offamine willarise after
them, and alltheplenty will beforgotten
intheland ofEgypt. Thefamine willcon-
sume theland,
31and theplenty will notbeknown in
theland byreason ofthat famine which
follows; foritwillbevery grievous.
32The dream was doubled toPharaoh,
because thething isestablished byGod,
andGod willshortly bring ittopass.
33“Now therefore letPharaoh look fora
discreet and wise man, and sethim over
theland ofEgypt.
34LetPharaoh dothis, and lethim ap-
point overseers over theland, andtake up
thefifth part oftheland ofEgypt ’sproduce
intheseven plenteous years.
35Letthem gather allthefood ofthese
good years that come, and store grain un-
derthehand ofPharaoh forfood inthe
cities, andletthem keep it.
36The food will betosupply theland
against theseven years offamine, which
willbeintheland ofEgypt; sothattheland
willnotperish through thefamine. ”
37The thing was good intheeyes of
Pharaoh, andintheeyes ofallhisservants.
38Pharaoh said tohisservants, “Canwe
find such aoneasthis, aman inwhom is
theSpirit ofGod? ”
39Pharaoh said toJoseph, “Because God
hasshown youallofthis, there isnooneso
discreet andwise asyou.40You shall beover myhouse. Allmy
people will beruled according toyour
word. Only inthethrone Iwillbegreater
than you. ”
41Pharaoh said toJoseph, “Behold, I
have setyouover alltheland ofEgypt. ”
42Pharaoh took offhissignet ring from
hishand, andputitonJoseph ’shand, and
arrayed him inrobes offinelinen, andput
agold chain about hisneck.
43Hemade him ride inthesecond char-
iotwhich hehad. They cried before him,
“Bow theknee! ”Hesethim over allthe
land ofEgypt.
44Pharaoh said toJoseph, “IamPharaoh.
Without you, noman shall liftuphishand
orhisfootinalltheland ofEgypt. ”
45Pharaoh called Joseph ’sname
Zaphenath-Paneah. Hegave him Asenath,
thedaughter ofPotiphera priest ofOnas
awife. Joseph went outover theland of
Egypt.
46Joseph was thirty years oldwhen he
stood before Pharaoh king ofEgypt. Joseph
went outfrom thepresence ofPharaoh,
andwent throughout alltheland ofEgypt.
47Intheseven plenteous years theearth
produced abundantly.
48Hegathered upallthefood ofthe
seven years which were intheland of
Egypt, and laid upthefood inthecities.
Hestored food ineach cityfrom thefields
around that city.
49Joseph laidupgrain asthesand ofthe
sea,very much, until hestopped counting,
foritwaswithout number.
50ToJoseph were born twosons before
theyear offamine came, whom Asenath,
thedaughter ofPotiphera priest ofOn,
bore tohim.
51Joseph called thename ofthefirstborn
Manasseh, †“For”,hesaid, “God hasmade
meforget allmytoil, and allmyfather ’s
house. ”
52The name ofthesecond, hecalled
Ephraim: ‡“ForGod hasmade mefruitful
intheland ofmyaffliction. ”
53Theseven years ofplenty, that were in
theland ofEgypt, came toanend.
†41:51 “Manasseh ”sounds liketheHebrew for “forget ”.‡41:52 “Ephraim ”sounds liketheHebrew for “twice
fruitful ”.

Genesis 41:54 45 Genesis 42:25
54The seven years offamine began to
come, justasJoseph had said. There was
famine inalllands, butinalltheland of
Egypt there wasbread.
55When alltheland ofEgypt was fam-
ished, the people cried toPharaoh for
bread, and Pharaoh said toalltheEgyp-
tians, “GotoJoseph. What hesays toyou,
do.”
56The famine was over allthesurface
oftheearth. Joseph opened allthestore
houses, and sold totheEgyptians. The
famine wassevere intheland ofEgypt.
57Allcountries came into Egypt, to
Joseph, tobuy grain, because thefamine
wassevere inalltheearth.
42
1Now Jacob saw that there was grain in
Egypt, andJacob said tohissons, “Why do
youlook atoneanother? ”
2Hesaid, “Behold, Ihave heard that
there isgrain inEgypt. Godown there, and
buyforusfrom there, sothat wemay live,
andnotdie. ”
3Joseph ’stenbrothers went down tobuy
grain from Egypt.
4But Jacob didn ’tsend Benjamin,
Joseph ’sbrother, with hisbrothers; forhe
said, “Lest perhaps harm happen tohim. ”
5Thesons ofIsrael came tobuy among
those who came, forthefamine was inthe
land ofCanaan.
6Joseph wasthegovernor over theland.
Itwas hewho sold toallthepeople ofthe
land. Joseph ’sbrothers came, and bowed
themselves down tohimwith their faces to
theearth.
7Joseph saw hisbrothers, and herec-
ognized them, butacted likeastranger to
them, and spoke roughly with them. He
said tothem, “Where didyoucome from? ”
They said, “From theland ofCanaan, to
buyfood. ”
8Joseph recognized hisbrothers, but
they didn ’trecognize him.
9Joseph remembered thedreams which
hedreamed about them, andsaid tothem,
“Youarespies! Youhave come toseethe
nakedness oftheland. ”
10They said tohim, “No,mylord, but
your servants have come tobuyfood.11Weareallone man ’ssons; weare
honest men. Your servants arenotspies. ”
12Hesaid tothem, “No,butyou have
come toseethenakedness oftheland! ”
13They said, “We, your servants, are
twelve brothers, thesons ofoneman inthe
land ofCanaan; and behold, theyoungest
istoday with our father, and one isno
more. ”
14Joseph said tothem, “Itislike Itold
you, saying, ‘Youarespies! ’
15Bythisyoushall betested. Bythelife
ofPharaoh, youshall notgooutfrom here,
unless your youngest brother comes here.
16Send oneofyou, andlethim getyour
brother, andyoushall bebound, that your
words may betested, whether there is
truth inyou, orelsebythelifeofPharaoh
surely youarespies. ”
17Heputthem alltogether into custody
forthree days.
18Joseph said tothem thethird day, “Do
this, andlive, forIfear God.
19Ifyouarehonest men, then letoneof
your brothers bebound inyour prison; but
yougo,carry grain forthefamine ofyour
houses.
20Bring your youngest brother tome;so
willyour words beverified, andyouwon ’t
die. ”
They didso.
21They said toone another, “Weare
certainly guilty concerning our brother,
inthat wesaw thedistress ofhissoul,
when hebegged us,and wewouldn ’tlis-
ten.Therefore thisdistress hascome upon
us.”
22Reuben answered them, saying,
“Didn ’tItellyou, saying, ‘Don ’tsinagainst
thechild, ’andyouwouldn ’tlisten? There-
fore also, behold, hisblood isrequired. ”
23They didn ’tknow that Joseph under-
stood them; forthere was aninterpreter
between them.
24Heturned himself away from them,
and wept. Then hereturned tothem,
andspoke tothem, andtook Simeon from
among them, and bound him before their
eyes.
25Then Joseph gave acommand tofill
their bags with grain, and torestore each
man ’smoney into hissack, and togive
--- PAGE 50 ---
Genesis 42:26 46 Genesis 43:11
them food fortheway. Soitwas done to
them.
26They loaded their donkeys with their
grain, anddeparted from there.
27Asoneofthem opened hissack togive
hisdonkey food inthelodging place, he
sawhismoney. Behold, itwasinthemouth
ofhissack.
28Hesaid tohisbrothers, “Mymoney is
restored! Behold, itisinmysack! ”Their
hearts failed them, andthey turned trem-
bling tooneanother, saying, “What isthis
that God hasdone tous?”
29They came toJacob their father, tothe
land ofCanaan, and told him allthat had
happened tothem, saying,
30“Theman, thelord oftheland, spoke
roughly with us,andtook usforspies ofthe
country.
31Wesaid tohim, ‘Wearehonest men.
Wearenospies.
32Wearetwelve brothers, sons ofour
father; one isnomore, and theyoungest
istoday with our father intheland of
Canaan. ’
33The man, thelord oftheland, said
tous, ‘Bythis Iwill know that you are
honest men: leave one ofyour brothers
with me,and take grain forthefamine of
your houses, andgoyour way.
34Bring your youngest brother tome.
Then Iwillknow thatyouarenotspies, but
that youarehonest men. SoIwilldeliver
your brother toyou, andyoushall trade in
theland. ’ ”
35Asthey emptied their sacks, behold,
each man ’sbundle ofmoney was inhis
sack. When they andtheir father sawtheir
bundles ofmoney, they were afraid.
36Jacob, their father, said tothem, “You
have bereaved meofmychildren! Joseph
isnomore, Simeon isnomore, and you
want totake Benjamin away. Allthese
things areagainst me. ”
37Reuben spoke tohisfather, saying,
“Killmytwo sons, ifIdon ’tbring him to
you. Entrust him tomycare, and Iwill
bring him toyouagain. ”
38Hesaid, “Mysonshall notgodown
with you; forhisbrother isdead, and heonly isleft. Ifharm happens tohim along
theway inwhich you go,then you will
bring down mygray hairs with sorrow to
Sheol. ”†
43
1Thefamine wassevere intheland.
2When they had eaten upthegrain
which they hadbrought outofEgypt, their
father said tothem, “Goagain, buy usa
little more food. ”
3Judah spoke tohim, saying, “Theman
solemnly warned us,saying, ‘Youshall not
seemyface, unless your brother iswith
you. ’
4Ifyou ’llsend ourbrother with us,we’ll
godown andbuyyoufood;
5butifyoudon ’tsend him, wewon ’tgo
down, fortheman said tous,‘Youshall not
seemyface, unless your brother iswith
you. ’ ”
6Israel said, “Why didyou treat meso
badly, telling theman that you had an-
other brother? ”
7They said, “The man asked directly
concerning ourselves, andconcerning our
relatives, saying, ‘Isyour father stillalive?
Have you another brother? ’Wejust an-
swered hisquestions. Isthere anyway we
could know that hewould say, ‘Bring your
brother down ’?”
8Judah said toIsrael, hisfather, “Send
theboywith me,and we’llgetupand go,
sothat wemay live, and notdie,both we,
andyou, andalso ourlittle ones.
9I’llbecollateral forhim. From myhand
willyourequire him. IfIdon ’tbring him
toyou, andsethim before you, then letme
bear theblame forever;
10forifwehadn ’tdelayed, surely we
would have returned asecond time by
now. ”
11Their father, Israel, said tothem, “If
itmust beso,then dothis: Take from the
choice fruits oftheland inyour bags, and
carry down apresent fortheman, alittle
balm, alittle honey, spices and myrrh,
nuts, andalmonds;
